# Simple Role Syntax
# ==================
# Supports bulk-adding hosts to roles, the primary server in each group
# is considered to be the first unless any hosts have the primary
# property set.  Don't declare `role :all`, it's a meta role.

role :app, %w{lrug@lrug.org}


# Extended Server Syntax
# ======================
# This can be used to drop a more detailed server definition into the
# server list. The second argument is a, or duck-types, Hash and is
# used to set extended properties on the server.

server 'lrug.org', user: 'lrug', roles: 'app'

set :deploy_to, "/home/lrug/sites/lrug.org/www/lrug_middleman"

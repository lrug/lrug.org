In April 2008 the [LRUG members](/members-and-friends/) decided to end their days wandering in the logo-less desert and choose an official LRUG logo.  Until this point LRUG didn't have an official logo, and whilst it wasn't really hurting the group, occasionally people we were involved with would ask for one and all we could do was look at our shoes, shuffle our feet and say "uh, we don't really have one".  To avoid embarrassment in the future when asked similar questions, we decided to finally settle the matter once and for all and come up with one.

Using [the mailing list](/mailing-list) we had a short call for submissions followed by a vote to choose which one of those would be the winner.

## The Winner

"El Rug" by Andrew McDonough

Of course, this isn't the end of the story, we now need someone to:

1. vectorise this image so it can be scaled properly
2. essentially re-draw it so it's less obviously copyright theft.

If you think you have the skills to help out with this, please get in touch with [me](mailto:murray.steele@gmail.com) or [the mailing list](/mailing-list) and we can finish the job.

### 2023 Update

After 15 long years in the blurry jpg wilderness, [Winston Ferguson](http://winstonferguson.com) stepped up to the plate and generated a gorgeous SVG version for us which we now use across the site:

Thanks Winston!

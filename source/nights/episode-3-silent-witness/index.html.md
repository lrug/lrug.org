Episode 3 of LRUG Nights will take place on Tuesday, 21st August at the [Fitzroy Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub6.html) on Charlotte Street. Come along for the usual mix of chat, boozing and ribaldry (and only the slightest mentions of metaprogramming). If you can't make it, [this is the kind of thing you might be in for](http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/silent-witness/episode/41743/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;2).

6.30pm, Fiztroy Tavern. See you there!

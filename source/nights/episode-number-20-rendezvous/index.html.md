Episode 20 of LRUG Nights will take place on Tuesday, March 30th 2010.

The week after the [Scottish Ruby Conference](http://scottishrubyconference.com/) there'll be a few visiting rubyists coming through London on their way home.  A few of them have got in touch and so we've arranged a special LRUG Nights to meet up with them.  We'll be spending the night in [The Harrison Bar](http://harrisonbar.co.uk/), starting at 6:30pm.

Come along if you want to say hi and get the low-down of the conference if you missed it, or continue the conference socializing if you did go.  Mitch might even make an appearance if he get's done [dealing with an embezzling wife and her murderous husband](http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/rendezvous/episode/41760/summary.html?tag=ep_guide;summary).

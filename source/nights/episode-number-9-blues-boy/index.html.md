Episode 9 of LRUG Nights will take place at the ["The Lyceum "](http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/69/694/Lyceum/Strand) on Wednesday July 30th.

Come along for the usual mix of chat, beer and [dangerous ex-cons](http://url.ie/ii3)). Mitch will be undercover, but will certainly be there.

Also, see [Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/911632/).

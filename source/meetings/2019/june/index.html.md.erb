## Agenda

### User-First Internationalisation

Tom Lord:

> Expanding a website internationally comes with many challenges; perhaps none more difficult than translating its content. In this talk, we will discuss pros and cons of various tools and techniques that my team have used to tackle this problem in ruby (along with some insight into how this differs for statically typed languages) - with a pragmatic goal of providing the best possible end-user experience at all times.

### Simplify writing code with deliberate commits

[Joel Chippindale](https://twitter.com/joelchippindale):

> As developers, a key part of our work, is in breaking down large gnarly complex problems into smaller simpler ones. But this is hard and there are many distractions along the way. In this talk I will take you through 5 habits to adopt around commiting your code which will help you keep focussed on these smaller simpler problems and make it easier for you to write good code.

### A practical guide for conducting efficient code reviews

[Gonçalo Morais](https://twitter.com/gnclmorais)

> Do you have code reviews at your daily work? Have you ever found yourself thinking they feel like a tug of war? That writing the code is the easy part of the job? That’s OK, we put so much emphasis in languages, patterns and lines of code that is easy to forget about other (soft) skills that are required every single day. This talk will provide you a few important thoughts to have in mind for a successful and fruitful code review, both in the shoes of the reviewer and the reviewee.

## Afterwards

All these talks will take us to around about 8pm, after which we have two
choices for socialising with your fellow LRUG attendees:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

The September 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of September*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#sep19registration).

## Agenda

### Computer Graphics for Ruby developers

[Stepan Khodzhaian](https://skillsmatter.com/members/mightykho):

> Computer graphics is a very broad and deep topic. The purpose of
> this talk is to show that up to a certain point it is not that
> complicated and you can get interesting looking results without
> driving yourself mad with insane mathematical equations, integrals,
> and whatnot.

### How to say no to Salesforce and build your own CRM

[Edwin Wills](https://twitter.com/edwinwills):

> In 2016 Rentify decided to ditch Salesforce and build our own CRM tool to
> help manage our growing portfolio of properties and tenants across London.
> I'll talk through why we did this, some of the features we've built, and how > we've structured the technology behind it.

### Have your Sorbet and eat it too

[Ju Liu](https://twitter.com/arkh4m):

> A short and sweet introduction to [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org), a type checker
> for Ruby. Learn how you can use types to write bulletproof code!

## Afterwards

This should all finish by 8pm, at which point we break out of the
classroom and offer you a choice for continuing the evening with your
fellow LRUG attendees:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#sep19registration}

[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

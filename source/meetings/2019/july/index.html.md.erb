## Agenda

### What does a Coconut and Serverless have in common?

[Denis Sellu](https://twitter.com/Denis_Sellu):

> Most developers (probably you) without knowing are already using serverless technologies. We will briefly explore just what it means for something to be serverless and how you can use it to enhance your solutions, so it can be another tool in your toolbox.

>  Using AWS and Google Cloud, we will then dive in to demo and examples to show you how to get started and the true potentials of serverless - plus tons of facts about coconuts Until last year the support for Ruby in the world of FAAS was next to non-existent, now that AWS Lambda has officially started supporting Ruby, I want to catch up any Rubyists who are not yet familiar with the technology, so it can be another tool for the toolbox.

### Small Tech Teams

[Tim Diggins](https://twitter.com/timdiggins):

> When I read the tech process literature I feel it's very interesting but it's often about quite a different universe from the world of working on small/tiny tech teams (teams with 1-3 developers/testers/architects/designers). Does that mean that the processes they talk about are only applicable to larger teams? Or maybe that small tech teams don't have the problems that these processes aim to solve. In this talk I want to start to unpick some of this, with the help of 40+ volunteers (thanks for your survey responses).

### Automating AWS Infrastructure for Rails Applications

[Adrian Booth](https://twitter.com/Adrian1707)

> In this talk I'll walk you through how to build a Cloud66 clone, a DevOps platform that's gaining ground in the Rails community. Wouldn't it be nice to provide a service with a Github link and have all the AWS infrastructure (EC2 servers, load balancers, databases etc) set up for you whilst you grind your coffee beans. Come to this talk to find out how easy that actually is.

## Afterwards

All these talks will take us to around about 8pm, after which we have two
choices for socialising with your fellow LRUG attendees:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#jul19registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

The January 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of January*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between
Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills
Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details are
given below](#jan19registration).

## Agenda

### Ruby Golf!

As is tradition, our first meeting of 2019 will be a slightly different kind of thing.  Instead
of talks, we'll be pulling all our not-suitable-for-production Ruby tricks out of the bag and
playing a few rounds of Ruby Golf!

For those unfamiliar with this, put your clubs away: code golfing is where you try to solve a
programming problem using the fewest possible number of characters. Unlike the rest of the time,
we don't care about elegance, we don't care about readability, and we definitely don't care
about performance -- make it short, then make it shorter!

Some quick tips to get you going:

* Descriptive local variable names? No thanks: `a`, `b`, and `c` will do just fine.
* Why use `collect` when you can use `map`?
* You may wish to `{` brace `}` yourself, lest you `do` worse in the `end`...

#### Format

* Bring your laptop and a recent Ruby version! Anything 2.2 and up should be fine
* We think this'll be more fun if you work in teams, so you can pool your ideas -- chances
  are that you know a trick or two that others haven't seen, and vice versa
* We will provide a repository of code which you can clone on the day. This will
  contain tests to give you confidence that your solution works, along with some helpers
  to count characters fairly across everyone participating


There are no official prizes, just bragging rights in the pub afterwards. Speaking of...

## Afterwards

We aim to finish by 8pm (although it may over-run depending on how much fun we're having!).

If you'd like to socialise with other LRUG attendees afterwards you have two choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#jan19registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

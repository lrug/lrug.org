The February 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 11th of February*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#feb19registration).

## Agenda

Our February meeting is our annual event devoted to short talks of no more
than 10 minutes.

### A different take on validation using the dry-validation gem

[Alfredo Motta](https://twitter.com/mottalrd):

> A short introduction to the [dry-validation
> gem](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-validation) and whether or not it
> might be a good fit for your next project. Both the internals of the
> gem based on a set of predicate logic primitives, and the API surface
> which uses a schema based declarative approach are different enough
> from existing alternatives that you should really have it under your
> radar.

### Capybara architecture overview

[Ben Holmes](http://benholmes.uk/):

> We'll briefly review the implementation of [Capybara's
> DSL](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) for browser testing.

### Automating Infrastructure Tasks with the Serverless Framework

[Bernat Rafales](https://twitter.com/brafales):

> How to leverage serverless tools to help you manage parts of your
> infrastructure

### Using Rails with a Content Distribution Network (CDN)

[Gideon Goldberg](https://twitter.com/gidsg):

> What is a CDN? Why use one? What support does Rails provide
> out-of-the-box and what customisations can you make to do more?

### A developer and a designer, getting along famously

[Celia Collins](https://twitter.com/celiadcollins) and [Boris Divjak](https://twitter.com/borisdivjak):

> A short story about how a developer and a designer can learn to fuel
> each-otherâ€™s ideas and why this matters. When our differences enable us
> to see things from different perspectives, we can take on bigger and
> more complex problems. When we collaborate every day, nothing can stop
> us.

### Humans are hard

[Matthew Rudy Jacobs](https://twitter.com/matthewrudy):

> and work with people.

{::coverage year="2019" month="february" talk="humans-are-hard" /}

### How to craft your commit history

[Tatiana Stantonian](https://twitter.com/binaryberry):

> A talk about the importance of narrating your code changes, with
> practical tips on using git to edit and reorganise your commits. In this
> talk you'll learn to resolve merge conflicts peacefully, use `git rebase
> interactive --autosquash`, refer to your commits using `:/keyword`
> instead of their SHA, and other exciting things!

### Using ActiveRecord types for backwards compatibility

[Alex Balhatchet](https://twitter.com/kaokun)

> How the CharlieHR team handled a tricky change by using a custom
> ActiveRecord type as a temporary backwards compatibility layer between
> the code and the database.

## Afterwards

Even with all these talks we still plan to finish around 8pm.  That's not
the end of the evening though, so if you'd like to socialise with other
LRUG attendees and chat about all the talks you've just seen you have two
choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#feb19registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

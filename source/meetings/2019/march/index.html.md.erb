The March 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 11th of March*,
at the slightly later time _6:30pm_ to _8:30pm_ (meeting start at _7pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#mar19registration).

## Agenda

## RSpec - Level Up

[Jon Rowe](https://twitter.com/JonRowe):

>You've been using RSpec for a while, you know how to write tests, but you’re not sure you're getting the most from it. This is a quick run through of some of the lesser known, more advanced features of RSpec.

## Education, Recruitment and Technology: What needs to change?

[Melissa Tranfield](https://twitter.com/MelTranfield):

>The traditional education system is letting down the next generation by not preparing them for the future of work. Edify is working to change this whilst planning to disrupt the public sector through the innovation of digital policy.

## Representations count

[Tom Stuart](https://twitter.com/tomstuart):

>In your grandparents’ attic you discover a mysterious old computer. You boot it up and discover it runs Ruby, but doesn’t support negative numbers! How can you implement negative numbers in an elegant way? We’ll explore two solutions and discover how important it is to pick the right representation.

## Afterwards

We plan to finish around 8:30pm.  That's not
the end of the evening though, so if you'd like to socialise with other
LRUG attendees and chat about all the talks you've just seen you have two
choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#mar19registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

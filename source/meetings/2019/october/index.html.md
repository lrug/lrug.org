## Agenda

### Concurrency in Crystal

[Lorenzo Barasti](https://twitter.com/lbarasti) says:

> [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) is a Ruby inspired language that
> offers type safety and a minimal runtime. In this talk we'll look into
> Crystal's concurrency model ([Communicating Sequential Processes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes))
> and how it shapes the way we write concurrent applications.

### How to stop worrying, love the SPA and appreciate Rails.

[Michael Nacos](https://twitter.com/mnacos) says:

> Some people love them, some people hate them, but single page
> applications are here to stay, if not take over. Michael suggests there
> may be greater SPA platform potential to Rails than you think.

### Using software engineering practices to improve engineering management

[Nicky Thompson](https://twitter.com/knotnicky) says:

> As an engineering manager, your responsibility is not to build features,
> but to build systems to support the people building the features. This
> talk will give some tips on using familiar tools and techniques from
> your time as a software engineer to help make management easier and more
> systematic.

## Afterwards

We aim to wrap all the talks up by 8pm and then move the meeting into
socialising mode.  You have a choice for this:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#oct19registration}

[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

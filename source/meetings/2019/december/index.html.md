Agenda
------

### Food

Not only are Farmdrop providing the venue for this meeting, they've also
kindly offered to supply some food to get us through the evening.  Thanks
again [Farmdrop](https://farmdrop.workable.com)!

### A talk

[Someone](https://twitter.com/on_twitter) says:

> something about their talk

Afterwards
----------
We aim to finish the talks by 8pm, although likely earlier if there isn't
a full complement of them, and will head to a nearby pub shortly after to
discuss what we've just heard and socialise.  Check back sooner to find
out which pub we'll head to.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

chance it.

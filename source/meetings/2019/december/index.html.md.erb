The December 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of December*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The venue this
month is provided by [Farmdrop](https://farmdrop.workable.com) and is in [their
offices][farmdrop-venue], near Old Street.  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#dec19registration).

## Agenda

### Food

Not only are Farmdrop providing the venue for this meeting, they've also
kindly offered to supply some food to get us through the evening.  Thanks
again [Farmdrop](https://farmdrop.workable.com)!

### Make Your System Observable

[Gerhard Lazu](https://twitter.com/gerhardlazu) says:

> This is what happened when RabbitMQ became more observable. The same
> benefits apply to your product too. Let me show you why.
>
> What does it mean for a system to be observable? Why is observability a
> requirement? How does it make everything better?

## Afterwards
We aim to finish the talks by 8pm, although likely earlier if there isn't
a full complement of them, and will head to a nearby pub shortly after to
discuss what we've just heard and socialise.  Check back sooner to find
out which pub we'll head to.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#dec19registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

The address of the venue:

> Farmdrop<br/>Classic House<br/>6th floor<br/>174-180 Old Street<br/>EC1V 9BP<br/><br/>[See on a map][farmdrop-venue]

### Registration

Farmdrop need a list of names and email addresses for reception so please
[complete this form for our new hosts][farmdrop-event].

The venue has a hard limit of 40 people and we'll manage this via that
form.  If you register and realise you can't come, you'll be able to edit
your response and we can then let more people come along.  We might be
able to let in people on the night who haven't registered, but I wouldn't
chance it.

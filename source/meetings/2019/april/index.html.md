Agenda
------

## Improve confidence in your code with mutation testing

[Rafał Szałański](https://twitter.com/rafa_szalanski):

>In this talk I'm going to explain mutation testing and how it helped me be more confident about my Ruby code, and also how to write better Ruby in the future.

## Giving my enemies a voice

[Shen Sat](https://twitter.com/shen_sat):

>I'm remaking a classic boxing video game, with a twist: the narrative is defined through the hopes, dreams and desires of the player's opponents, not the player themselves. I'll be talking about flipping enemy design in games on its head, as well as demoing a key part of my boxing game: the trash-talk engine!

Afterwards
----------

We plan to finish around 8pm.  That's not
the end of the evening though, so if you'd like to socialise with other
LRUG attendees and chat about all the talks you've just seen you have two
choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

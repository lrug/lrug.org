## Change of venue!

We received the sad news today that Skills Matter has gone into administration and all meet-ups and conferences have been cancelled with immediate effect.

Thankfully our friends at the FT have stepped in last minute to provide a venue. Full details of the event below:

The November 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 4th of November*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [FT][ft-venue] near St Paul's, is
provided by the [FT](https://subs.ft.com/spa3_bc1).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#nov19registration).

## Agenda

### Call the Cops: Bringing style to a lawless codebase

[Scott Matthewman](https://twitter.com/scottm) says:

> Working with legacy codebases can be tricky at the best of times. What can
> make it worse if there’s no consistency in style. Linters (and Ruby’s RuboCop
> in particular) can help us write good code going forward – but what about the
> code that’s already there? There are good ways, and bad, to get RuboCop to
> help.

### Disk is fast, memory is slow. Forget all you think you know

[Daniel Magliola](https://twitter.com/dmagliola) says:

> Adding metrics to your code should effectively have no impact on performance.
> When we were recently tasked with doing that in multi-process Ruby servers, we
> ran into an interesting challenge: could we aggregate our numbers across
> processes without blowing our target of just one microsecond of overhead? In
> the process, we found some very counter-intuitive performance results that I'd
> like to share with you.

## Afterwards
We're hoping to find a nearby pub for socialising after the talks (which should be wrapped up by 8pm) - suggestions welcome!

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

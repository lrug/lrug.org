## Agenda

### Getting the next generation into coding

[Pablo Brasero Moreno](https://twitter.com/pablobm):

> In the last few years, I've been involved in teaching coding to people
> from several walks of life, including children. In this talk, I'll share
> my thoughts and experiences on teaching children to code.

### Monoids

[John Cinnamond](https://twitter.com/jcinnamond):

> Mathematics can make you a better person. Well, not really. It can, 
> however, help you think about programming. This talk provides a very quick 
> introduction to a branch of mathematics called 'general algebra' and looks
> at how it can apply to programming. We then take a real world programming 
> challenge and solve it algebraically, then convert that algebraic solution
> into working code. By the end you'll be left feeling confused, perhaps a 
> little angry, almost certainly a little bored. But without even noticing 
> anything has changed you'll soon start to look at difficult software
> problems and see past the superficial complexity to get a better 
> understanding of the underlying structures at play. And you'll be a better
> person for it.

### Writing more elegant queries with ActiveRecord

Josh Fleck:

> So often, the biggest bottleneck to scaling is the database. It's also
> one of the areas where a little engineering effort goes a long way. 
> This talk exists because I think it is very rewarding to write queries
> with ActiveRecord that are easily readable and able to scale. We'll 
> walk through some real world examples of refactoring some mingin' 
> ActiveRecord queries, learn optimisation techniques you can put to work
> right away, and build a deeper knowledge of relational databases.

## Afterwards

All these talks will take us to around about 8pm, after which we have two
choices for socialising with your fellow LRUG attendees:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#may19registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

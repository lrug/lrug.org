## Agenda

## The Case of the Missing Method — A Ruby Mystery Story

[Nadia Odunayo](https://twitter.com/nodunayo):

> Business is slow for Ruby Private Investigator, Deirdre Bug. She’s
> on the verge of switching industry when she gets a call from an
> anxious young man. "Some class methods have gone missing," he tells
> her breathlessly. "I need your help."
>
> Deirdre takes the case and begins exploring Ruby objects behind the
> scenes. Though she thinks she's on familiar ground — Ruby's object
> model, method lookup — she's about to discover that she really has no
> clue.

## The problem with compiling Ruby

[Vidar Hokstad](https://twitter.com/vhokstad):

> To get maximum performance out of a language, compilation is key, and people > have been trying to compile Ruby for a long time, ranging from jRuby and
> Truffle Ruby to the experimental method JIT in Ruby 2.6. But Ruby is a very
> challenging language to compile efficiently. The talk will explore some of
> the reasons based on what I've learned while working on my own Ruby compiler
> as described in my series of blog posts at http://hokstad.com/compiler

## Pro Capybara Herding: Feature Testing Tips

[Oli Peate](https://twitter.com/olipeate):

> How do I debug JavaScript during a test? And how about emulating mobile
> devices? More importantly how do I mute this video I need to test?! Learn
> about these topics and more in this lightning talk about testing with
> Capybara & Chrome

## Afterwards

We aim to finish up the talks by 8pm.  This doesn't mean you have to go home
though, if you're keen to talk about what you've just heard, or just mingle with
your fellow attendees you have a couple of choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
   drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
   network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
   the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.

## Venue & Registration {#dec18registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to make sure we have the room
laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the
larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's
good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].

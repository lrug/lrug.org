The May 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on *Wednesday the 9th of May*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#may18registration).

Agenda
------

We've got three great talks for you in May:

## Software Development – a view from the Boardroom

[Alan Buxton](https://twitter.com/alanbuxton) says:

> Chances are you are building software for a business to use or sell, or both.
> It’s likely that there is a board of directors involved making decisions that
> affect you and your software. This talk aims to give you a personal insight
> into what it’s like to be a CTO on a startup’s board in the hope that it
> gives you another perspective on ‘the business’ and helps you become a more
> rounded developer.

## An Introduction to Event Sourcing

[Alfredo Motta](https://twitter.com/mottalrd)

> [Event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) is a recently
> developed design pattern to build applications that are domain centric and easy to
> extend. The pattern is based on the usage of a persistent event log which 
> substitutes the more classical relational database model for Rails applications.
> Such event log can then be used for extending your application in all sort of 
> creative ways. For example, by synchronizing data between your microservices, 
> trigger side effects without cluttering your models or controllers, or build data
> views optimized for your query needs. In this talk, I'll present the basic ideas, 
> some of the tradeoffs and challenges you might find and how you could start 
> experimenting with it.

## On Writing <%= code %>

[Elliot Hilaire](https://twitter.com/elliotthilaire)

> Writing code in high-level programming languages began in the 1950s. In contrast, 
> writing goes back more than 5000 years. So, what can we learn from people who
> study writing? This talk explores concepts from three books about writing and 
> applies them to coding.

Afterwards
----------

We should be done with the talks by 8pm, but there's bound to be plenty
to talk about after these so if you want to chat to your fellow attendees or
the speakers afterwards you have a couple of choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
   drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
   network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
   the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases

the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

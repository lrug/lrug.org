The June 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 18th of June*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#jun18registration).

## Agenda

Our June meeting has two talks and a prize draw!

## How to grow a small development team

[Najaf Ali](https://twitter.com/alinajaf) says:

> This talk is about how we grew the team at Happy Bear Software. In this talk
> I'll discuss:
>
> * How working at a given company fits into a developer's career
> * Finding candidates
> * Selection
> * On-boarding
> * Retention
> * What to do when people leave your team
>
> Much of how we hire is specific to our business and our goals, but there will
> hopefully be two or three techniques, practices, or principles that you can
> apply to your hiring process.

## Breaking into computers over the Internet

[David Somers](https://twitter.com/jalada) wants to tell us how to protect the software you build:

> I’ll start by talking briefly about the protocols computers use to
> communicate. Then I'll discuss how they can be abused by demoing some of the
> tools and techniques security professionals (and hackers) use to scan and
> infiltrate servers. If the demo gods are on my side, I’ll break in to a
> vulnerable system or two to show you how easy it is for people to exploit
> known vulnerabilities in software you, as a software developer, may be
> responsible for keeping up to date. Then finally I'll cover some ways to
> protect the software you write from those types of attacks.

## Brighton Ruby ticket prizedraw

{::sponsor name="Streetbees" size="main" /}

The kind people at [Streetbees](https://www.streetbees.com/careers), an
Artificial Intelligence based Market Research platform bolstered by powerful
community building tools, have bought us a couple of tickets to [the Brighton
Ruby conference](https://brightonruby.com) on Friday, 6th July 2018.  We'll be
running a prize draw at this meeting; if you attend on the night your name will
be entered in the giveaway and the winning names will be drawn from a
hat<sup>[*](#brtp-hat)</sup>.

Thanks [streetbees](https://www.streetbees.com/careers)!

<sup><a name="brtp-hat">*</a></sup> <small>We may not use an actual hat.</small>

## Afterwards

Our talks will finish by 8pm, but that doesn't have to be the end of the evening
for you.  If you'd like to talk to the speakers, or to other attendees about the
talks, or other goings on in the ruby community you have a couple of options:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
   drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
   network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
   the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

Agenda
------

### You’re doing documentation wrong (and so am I)

[Scott Matthewman](https://twitter.com/scottm) says:

> As developers, we’re always asked to write more documentation. Some of us
> even do it without being asked. But look around the web and you’ll see
> countless gems, applications and source code examples whose documentation
> is either missing or makes no sense. How can we make little changes to the
> way we think about documentation to make things better?

### Sliding Puzzles

[Chris Patuzzo](https://twitter.com/chrispatuzzo) says:

> Did you ever play with one of those cheap plastic-y tile puzzles as a
> child? Let's try to solve them with Ruby and use that as an excuse to talk
> about combinatorics, complexity theory and proof.

### TBC

[You](mailto:talks@lrug.org) can take this slot if you have a 10 or 25 minute
talk you'd like to give.  Get in touch with us at: [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org)

Drinks Sponsor
--------------

{::sponsor name="Explore" size="main" /}

The nice people at [The Explore Group](https://www.explore-group.com/)
have arranged to provide us with drinks. They have arranged to put
some money behind the bar after the meeting in the Skills Matter
downstairs bar area.

The Explore Group has been helping companies recruit top talent in the
ever-evolving world of technology since 2005. They're keen to speak
with Ruby on Rails developers looking for their next challenge.

Thanks for supporting us [The Explore Group](https://www.explore-group.com/)!

Afterwards
----------

Our aim is to finish the talks by 8pm. The night doesn't have to end there
though, to continue hanging out with other LRUG attendees you can visit:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases

The February 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of February*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node](skills-matter-venue) between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#feb18registration).

## Agenda

In February we devote our whole evening to lightning talks of no more than 10
minutes.  This year our talks are:

## The Human Cost of Messy Code

[Adrian Booth](https://twitter.com/Adrian1707) says:

> What are the real costs behind a messy codebase? It’s not just about being
> harder to change and annoying to work with. There are human costs to these
> decisions we make every day that have implications beyond the codebase.

## Search Relevancy

[Rosa Fox](https://twitter.com/rosaemerald) says:

> A quick introduction to search result relevancy featuring GOV.UK.

## \_why Symbol#to\_proc works and more

[Simon George](https://twitter.com/sfcgim) says:

> How `Symbol#to_proc` found its way into Ruby core, who put it there, ways it
> can be extended, and a crude drawing of a fish.

## Introduction to Active Storage

[Dan Kim](https://twitter.com/dankimio) says:

> A brief introduction to Active Storage, a new library for cloud attachments
> in Rails applications. How to install Active Storage and integrate it with
> cloud services like Amazon S3. Comparison to the existing file upload
> solutions.

## Things I wish I'd known about Ruby Gems

[Iain Beeston](https://twitter.com/iainbeeston) says:

> I want to give a talk that discusses a handful of topics related to rubygems,
> that might be interesting for devs who haven't published a gem before or don't
> know how they work. I'd like to discuss what a gem really is, how gem loading
> works, how to debug errors coming from a gem you're using and how to make your
> own gem.

## Increase your quality of life: An RSpec primer

[Elena Tanasoiu](https://twitter.com/elenatanasoiu) says:

> If you can’t be arsed to read a book about RSpec, this talk is for you. I’m
> here to offer you a short but sweet look into Rspec and what it can do. It’s
> a list of nice to knows, but did you actually know them? Based on [“Effective
> testing with Rspec 3” by Myron Marston and Ian Dees](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3)

## Git commit signing: Code we can trust?

[Matthew Rudy Jacobs](https://twitter.com/matthewrudy) says:

> When we install software on our computers we have to trust the package maintainers that it's secure.
>
> If someone slips a hack into homebrew all of our machines could become vulnerable.
>
> But what about our own code?
> * When we deploy to production, how do we know we can trust it?
> * What if someone pushes a hack to our github?
> * Will CI still push it to production?
>
> It turns out Git has a cool feature that can help us trust the code we deploy.
> We'll discuss Git Commit Signing, how it can help us, and what downsides it may have.

## Afterwards

We should be done with the talks by 8pm, but there's bound to be plenty
to talk about after these so if you want to chat to your fellow attendees or
the speakers afterwards you have a couple of choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
   drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
   network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
   the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.

## Venue & Registration {#feb18registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

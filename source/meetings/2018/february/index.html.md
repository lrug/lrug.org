The February 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of February*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node](skills-matter-venue) between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#feb18registration).

Agenda
------

In February we devote our whole evening to lightning talks of no more than 10
minutes.  This year our talks are:

## The Human Cost of Messy Code

[Adrian Booth](https://twitter.com/Adrian1707) says:

> What are the real costs behind a messy codebase? It’s not just about being
> harder to change and annoying to work with. There are human costs to these
> decisions we make every day that have implications beyond the codebase.

## Search Relevancy

[Rosa Fox](https://twitter.com/rosaemerald) says:

> A quick introduction to search result relevancy featuring GOV.UK.

## \_why Symbol#to\_proc works and more

[Simon George](https://twitter.com/sfcgim) says:

> How `Symbol#to_proc` found its way into Ruby core, who put it there, ways it
> can be extended, and a crude drawing of a fish.

## Software Development – a view from the Boardroom

[Alan Buxton](https://twitter.com/alanbuxton) says:

> Chances are you are building software for a business to use or sell, or both.
> It’s likely that there is a board of directors involved making decisions that
> affect you and your software. This talk aims to give you a personal insight
> into what it’s like to be a CTO on a startup’s board in the hope that it
> gives you another perspective on ‘the business’ and helps you become a more
> rounded developer.

## Introduction to Active Storage

[Dan Kim](https://twitter.com/dankimio) says:

> A brief introduction to Active Storage, a new library for cloud attachments
> in Rails applications. How to install Active Storage and integrate it with
> cloud services like Amazon S3. Comparison to the existing file upload
> solutions.

## More

There'll be another few talks too, watch this space!

Afterwards
----------

We should be done with the talks by 8pm, but there's bound to be plenty
to talk about after these so if you want to chat to your fellow attendees or
the speakers afterwards you have a couple of choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
   drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
   network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
   the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.

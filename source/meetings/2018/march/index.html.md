The March 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of March*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between
Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills
Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details are
given below](#mar18registration).

## Agenda

### Web Architecture choices & Ruby

[Tomas Valent](https://twitter.com/equivalent8) says:

> I'll try to talk about most popular web application architecture choices
> (monolith, micro-service, serverless and their variations) from the
> perspective of a Ruby developer. When is good to use one over the other and
> philosophies behind them.

### Strong opinions, loosely held

[Alex Heeton](https://twitter.com/alexheeton) says:

> Strong opinions and principles are a great thing to have. In this talk I'll
> share some of my principles, and show how they've helped me grow teams and
> build more robust software, with a special focus on managing larger Rails
> applications.

### Make responsive emails super-duper easily with MJML

[Chris O’Sullivan](https://twitter.com/thechrisoshow) says:

> If you're like me, you hate making HTML emails that work across email apps
> and devices. In this lightning talk I'm going to introduce you to MJML - a
> markup language that takes a lot of pain out of making responsive emails. You
> can find more information at http://mjml.io.

## Afterwards

The talks should be finished by 8pm. If you'd like to socialise with other LRUG
attendees afterwards, you have two choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

## Venue & Registration {#mar18registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

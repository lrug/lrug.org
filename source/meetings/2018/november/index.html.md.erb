## Agenda

## Open Banking - From Scraping to APIs

[Toby Pinder](https://twitter.com/tobypinder):

> Banking is changing, and so is the way we interact with financial services. In
> this talk we’ll be touching on what Open Banking is and why it’s interesting
> to software developers. Then we'll launch ourselves into some of the APIs from
> a rubyist perspective and the real world experiences and challenges of working
> in a complex ecosystem that contains both established banking institutions and
> fintech startups.

### Food!

{::sponsor name="GitHub" size="main" /}

The nice people at [GitHub](https://github.com/) have sponsored this meeting
by buying some pizza for us to eat.  It'll be laid out downstairs in the Skills
Matter bar area and there will options for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free
diets.  It'll be available from about 6 and will last until it's all been eaten.
There should be plenty, but turn up early if you want to make sure you get some.

Thanks again to [GitHub](https://github.com/) for supporting us!

## Afterwards

We aim to finish up the talks by 8pm.  This doesn't mean you have to go home
though, if you're keen to talk about what you've just heard, or just mingle with
your fellow attendees you have a couple of choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
   drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
   network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
   the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.

## Venue & Registration {#nov18registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to make sure we have the room
laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the
larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's
good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].

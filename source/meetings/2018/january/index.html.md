The January 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of January*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between
Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills
Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details are
given below](#january18registration).

Agenda
------

### Quiz!

Our first meeting of 2018 will be a slightly different kind of thing.  Instead
of talks there'll be a quiz.  We did this in [2007](/meetings/2007/january) and
[2013](/meetings/2013/january/) so if you attended those you'll know what to
expect.  If not the details are below

#### Format

The quiz will be run as 5 separate rounds.  The first four are themed on the
words in LRUG (London, Ruby, Users, and Group).  The 5th round is a picture
round which will be given to each team to complete throughout the evening and
marked at the end.  The picture round questions will be based around the same
4 themes as the other rounds.

* Round 1: *L*ondon
* Round 2: *R*uby (more community and history than technical details)
* Round 3: *U*sers (famous and historical people)
* Round 4: *G*roup (music)
* Round 5: picture round

Each round will have 10 questions, but there'll be bonus points available
throughout the quiz for exceptional answers.

#### Rules

1. Teams should have no more than 4 members (we may adjust this up or down on
   the night depending on attendance or prize divisibility).
2. Utilising internet devices to obtain answers is strictly forbidden - we
   expect you to use your onboard brain, not your outboard one.
3. The quiz master's word is final in any disputes.

#### Prizes

Our lovely sponsors have donated the following:

1. Copies of [“99 Bottles of OOP”](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) by
   [Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com/) and [Katrina
   Owen](http://www.kytrinyx.com/) provided by:
   <br/>
   {::sponsor name="Unboxed" size="main" /}

2. Copies of [“Exceptional Ruby”](http://exceptionalruby.com/) by [Avdi
   Grimm](http://www.virtuouscode.com/) provided by:
   <br/>
   {::sponsor name="Explore" size="main" /}

3. Parcels of [Pact coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/) provided by:
   <br/>
   {::sponsor name="Carwow" size="main" /}

We're still looking for more sponsors to provide prizes for the winners.  If we have
enough prizes some of the runners up will also get prizes.  If you can help
us out please do get in touch with us at
[sponsors@lrug.org](mailto:sponsors@lrug.org).  Other than the warm glow in
your stomach of helping us out the benefits of sponsorship [are explained
on our readme site](http://readme.lrug.org/#sponsorship).

Afterwards
----------

We aim to finish the quiz by 8pm (although it may over-run depending on how
long the marking and prize-giving takes).  There's bound to be some heated
debate about how cruel the questions were and how your particularly funny
ruby pun-based team name was robbed of the best team-name bonus. If you'd
like to socialise with other LRUG attendees afterwards you have two choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

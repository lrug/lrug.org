The October 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on *Tuesday the 9th of October*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node][skills-matter-venue] between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#oct18registration).

## Agenda

We've got three great talks for you in October:

## Unicode Spaß 
[Leif Gensert](https://twitter.com/leifg)

> How do programming languages deal with the rules of languages? And what happens if these rules change?


## hubbaDDDo
[Stanisław Klajn](https://skillsmatter.com/members/broisatse)

> Hubbado is an online, community-driven job marketplace. We'd like to share how we explore our domain of job-matching and use the resulting domain knowledge to improve our system design. We will also cover some techniques of extracting domain logic within existing Rails application using Trailblazer and service objects as well as some patterns we are trying out to reduce coupling in relatively large application like CQRS with Event Sourcing.

## Interface incantations

> According to the witches of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld, most magic is simply headology. This talk will mix literary references and outline the headology of interface design, from basic charms and illusions that fool and entice us to the unforgivable curses that can shape our thinking and behaviour.


## Afterwards

We should be done with the talks by 8pm, but there's bound to be plenty
to talk about after these so if you want to chat to your fellow attendees or
the speakers afterwards you have a couple of choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
   drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
   network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
   the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.

## Venue & Registration {#oct18registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to

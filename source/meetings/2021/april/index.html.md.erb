The April 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of April*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  It's our first
meeting of the 2nd year of remote-only LRUG.

[Full registration details are given below](#april21registration), note
that **the zoom meeting url is only sent to registered attendees, so
please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got one talk lined up for you this month so far.  We've always space
for more though.  Email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if you've
got something you'd like to share with your fellow LRUG attendees.

### Git Rebase

[Brooke Kuhlmann](https://www.alchemists.io) says:

> Git is the dominant tool for version management. Misunderstanding and
> misusing Git can cost development teams time, energy, and money. Few
> better examples exist than Git's default merge workflow which creates
> repositories that are hard to read, debug, and maintain. In this
> talk, I'll show how to use the [Git Rebase
> Workflow](https://www.alchemists.io/articles/git_rebase) instead,
> which puts Git to work for you to produce quality code that's easy to
> handle and kicks your team into high gear.
>
> Your questions will be answered by [Brooke
> Kuhlmann](https://www.alchemists.io/team/brooke_kuhlmann) who is the
> founder of the [Alchemists](https://www.alchemists.io) where the
> mission is to create an inclusive and thoughtful collective focused
> on the craft, quality, ethics, and security of software engineering.

## Afterwards

Despite spending a year doing this, we've yet to work out a decent online
version of the post-meeting pub.  That said, we leave the zoom call
running aftet the talks are over and the formal goodbyes have been said.
You're more than welcome to hang out with the handful of folk who do stay
on.  If you've got any ideas for something better let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

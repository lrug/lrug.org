## Agenda

We've got one talk lined up for you this month so far.  We've always space
for more though.  Email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if you've
got something you'd like to share with your fellow LRUG attendees.

## Afterwards

Despite spending a year doing this, we've yet to work out a decent online
version of the post-meeting pub.  That said, we leave the zoom call
running aftet the talks are over and the formal goodbyes have been said.
You're more than welcome to hang out with the handful of folk who do stay
on.  If you've got any ideas for something better let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

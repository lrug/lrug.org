The October 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on _Monday the 11th of October_,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#oct21registration), and
please do note that **the zoom meeting url is only sent to registered
attendees, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

### Solargraph: A Ruby language server to make your editor smart

[Fritz Meissner](https://twitter.com/fritzmeissner) has been working on the fledgling
[solargraph-rails](https://github.com/iftheshoefritz/solargraph-rails)
plugin and wants to tell us all about it:

> Language servers like [Solargraph](https://solargraph.org) can give code
> editing superpowers to your favourite editor (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.).
> I'll talk about the Language Server Protocol and its advantages over
> editor-specific plugins, as well as how Solargraph learns about your
> Ruby. I'll also talk about the challenges that Rails poses for such
> tooling and how solargraph-rails attempts to overcome them.

### How denormalizing our Postgres turned great

[Thierry Deo](https://github.com/tdeo) co-founder and lead dev at
[Pennylane](https://www.pennylane.com) is going to tell us all about
optimising their postgresql db:

> It's often considered best practice to normalize the database structure
> to avoid data redundancy and incoherence. In Pennylane's accounting
> platform we've found that this actually does not always help with data
> coherence, and even introduces additional complexity in managing data
> access. Our combination of denormalizing some of our data, enhancing
> some of ActiveRecord's methods, and introducing default behaviors in our
> application models has enabled us to greatly simplify access control
> management and given us confidence that our production data is in a
> consistent state.

## Afterwards

We do our best to keep the zoom call open for a while after the talks for
those attendees that want to chat for a bit afterwards. It lacks the
general cacophonous ambiance of a pub, and you'll have to bring your own
drinks and chips, but it's better than nothing. The speakers may be
available so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the
meeting, or that you felt were too niche to share with the wider group.
If you've got any ideas for something better, then please do let us know
at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

## Registration {#oct21registration}

Prior to attending you **must** familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying particular attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we float on screens like so many tiny programming postage stamps.

### Secure your place

Our Zoom meetings are artificially constrained by our miserly purses, so
**[you need to register via eventbrite][oct2021-eventbrite]** to secure a
place. We only send the link to the zoom meeting to people who have
registered. It goes out around about 6pm on the day of the meeting, so
keep an eye out for it and check your spam just in case.

Give yourself a head-start by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download) (lol, as if you don't already have it).

The October 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on _Monday the 11th of October_,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#oct21registration), and
please do note that **the zoom meeting url is only sent to registered
attendees, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

We do our best to keep the zoom call open for a while after the talks for
those attendees that want to chat for a bit afterwards. It lacks the
general cacophonous ambiance of a pub, and you'll have to bring your own
drinks and chips, but it's better than nothing. The speakers may be
available so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the
meeting, or that you felt were too niche to share with the wider group.
If you've got any ideas for something better, then please do let us know
at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

## Registration {#oct21registration}

Prior to attending you **must** familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying particular attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we float on screens like so many tiny programming postage stamps.

### Secure your place

Our Zoom meetings are artificially constrained by our miserly purses, so
**[you need to register via eventbrite][oct2021-eventbrite]** to secure a
place. We only send the link to the zoom meeting to people who have
registered. It goes out around about 6pm on the day of the meeting, so
keep an eye out for it and check your spam just in case.

Give yourself a head-start by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download) (lol, as if you don't already have it).

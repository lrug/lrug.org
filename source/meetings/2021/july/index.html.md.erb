## Afterwards

The zoom call will stay open after the talks are finished for a little bit
if attendees want to chat for a while.  The speakers may hang out so you
can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting.  If you've
got any ideas for something better let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

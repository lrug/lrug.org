## Agenda

### Breaking Up Monoliths With CRC cards

[Hemal Varambhia](https://twitter.com/hnvarambhia) from [Simply Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk) says:

> Rapid iteration and feedback is key to enhancing agility. This is an
> experience report on how we appealed to a modelling technique from the
> 1980s, CRC cards, to figure out how we might break away part of a monolith
> at the architectural level and guide refactorings at the softer design
> level.

### Ruby on Rails for Fun and Social Good

[Alex Rudall](https://twitter.com/alexrudall) from [Beam](https://beam.org) says:

> Beam is the world's first crowdfunding platform for homelessness. Alex
> will talk about what Beam does and how Beam uses Ruby on Rails,
> Airtable, Vue.js and Tailwind to help them change the lives of homeless
> people.

### Improving Rails scalability using modularity with enforced boundaries

[Rob Faldo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertfaldo/) says:

> One of the aspects of Ruby & Rails that gives it the reputation for not
> scaling well is that unlike some languages/frameworks it has no way to
> enforce modularity. Over time and with many developers this usually
> leads to 'spaghetti code'. This talk will introduce a solution to this
> problem called [packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk) (a ruby
> gem by Shopify), as well as touch on some alternatives.

got any ideas for something better let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

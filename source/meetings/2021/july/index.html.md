## Agenda

### Breaking Up Monoliths With CRC cards

[Hemal Varambhia](https://twitter.com/hnvarambhia) from [Simply Business]() says:

> Rapid iteration and feedback is key to enhancing agility. This is an
> experience report on how we appealed to a modelling technique from the
> 1980s, CRC cards, to figure out how we might break away part of a monolith
> at the architectural level and guide refactorings at the softer design
> level.

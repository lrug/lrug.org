## Agenda

### Enough coverage to beat the band

[Kevin Murphy](https://twitter.com/kevin_j_m) says:

> The lights cut out. The crowd roars. It’s time. The band takes the stage.
> They’ve practiced the songs, particularly the *covers*. They’ve sound
> checked the *coverage* of the speakers. They know the lighting rig has the
> proper colored gels *covering* the lamps. They’re nervous, but they’ve got
> it all __covered__.

### When ActiveRecord meets CTE!?

[Johnson Zhan](https://twitter.com/johnsonzhan121) says:

> CTE (`Common Table Expression`) is one of the ways we handle complicated
> SQL queries. However, ActiveRecord does not support CTE directly so I used
> to write some raw SQL to implement CTE. Now, I found there is a useful gem
> called `activerecord-cte` which makes things different.

### Finding, hiring and onboarding junior Ruby developers

[Alex Balhatchet](https://twitter.com/kaokun) says:

> The Ruby community in London has a huge number of junior
> developers, largely thanks to bootcamps like Le Wagon and Makers Academy.
> This talk describes my experiences finding, hiring and onboarding junior
> devs. The aim is for the hiring managers in the room to feel more confident
> hiring junior devs for their teams, and for the junior devs in the room to
> feel more confident asking for support and learning opportunities.

## Afterwards

It's been nearly 2 years of this and we still haven't worked out a good
replacement for hanging out in the pub after the meeting. That said we
leave the zoom call running for a little while after the talks for
folk to chat. We encourage the speakers to hang around too if they can,
so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting, or
that you felt were too niche to share with the wider group. If you've got
any ideas for something better, then please do let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

## Registration {#dec21registration}

Prior to attending you **must** familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying particular attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we float on screens like so many tiny programming postage stamps.

### Secure your place

Our Zoom meetings are artificially constrained by our miserly purses, so
**[you need to register via eventbrite][dec2021-eventbrite]** to secure a
place. We only send the link to the zoom meeting to people who have
registered. It goes out around about 6pm on the day of the meeting, so
keep an eye out for it and check your spam just in case.

Give yourself a head-start by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download) (lol, as if you don't already have it).

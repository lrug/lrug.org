The January 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 11th of January*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  Still online.

[Full registration details are given below](#jan21registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got one talk lined up for you this month, but we always need more.
Email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if you'd like to start your
2021 presenting to the enthralled hordes of LRUG attendees.

## Afterwards

We're all at home so there's no post-meeting pub meetup, however a few
attendees often hang around on in the zoom call after the talks are over.
It's a pale-shadow of the pub meetup, so if you have some ideas about
doing something better do get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#jan21registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we are all in our own little bubbles.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the
meeting so **[you need to register via eventbrite][jan2021-eventbrite]**.
The link to the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on
the day of the meeting, around about 6pm. Keep an eye out for the email
and check your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

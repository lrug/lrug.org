The January 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 11th of January*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  Still online.

[Full registration details are given below](#jan21registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got one talk lined up for you this month, but we always need more.
Email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if you'd like to start your
2021 presenting to the enthralled hordes of LRUG attendees.

### Recruiting 101 instead of 404

[Thayer Prime](https://twitter.com/teamPrimeLtd) says:

> Recruitment is one of the hardest problems in scaling your tech company.
> Everyone wants the best, everyone wants diversity in hires, everyone
> wants the most affordable people - but companies rarely have the time,
> money or ability to invest in creating a world class recruiting team. So
> what are some of the common questions we can review, and how do you
> navigate the pitfalls of bad hiring as a starter for ten? Come and find
> out from an LRUG community Q&A to address some of the most commonly
> asked questions, and get some starter tips on hiring humans, not
> resources.
>
> Your Qs will be A'd by [Thayer Prime, of Team
> Prime](https://team-prime.com/about/) who started life in the tech
> industry as a programmer twenty years ago, before turning to the dark
> arts of recruitment. She's been lucky enough to work with the likes of
> Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Jimmy Wales, Apple, Stripe and NASA to name just a
> few. She has founded three successful companies herself, and often acts
> as a strategic adviser to founders and C-level executives growing their
> tech capacity within their organisations.

For info on how to submit questions for the talk [check out Thayer's email
to the mailing list](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2020-December/025636.html)
explaining the situation.

## Afterwards

We're all at home so there's no post-meeting pub meetup, however a few
attendees often hang around on in the zoom call after the talks are over.
It's a pale-shadow of the pub meetup, so if you have some ideas about
doing something better do get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

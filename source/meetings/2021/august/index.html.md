## Agenda

### 10 years on - building startups with Ruby on Rails

[Tom Blomfield](https://twitter.com/t_blom) from [Generation Home](https://www.generationhome.com):

> Tom was the founder of GoCardless (built in Ruby) and Monzo.
> He recently joined the board of Generation Home (also Ruby) - a
> London-based mortgage provider. He's come back to talk about the evolution
> of the London startup community and how successful fintechs are still
> building on Ruby on Rails

### Do regex dream of Turing Completeness?

[Daniel Magliola](https://twitter.com/dmagliola) says:

> We're used to using Regular Expressions every day for pattern matching and
> text replacement, but... What can Regexes actually do? How far can we push
> them? Can we implement actual logic with them?
>
> What if I told you... You can actually implement Conway's Game of Life with
> just a Regex? What if I told you... You can actually implement ANYTHING with
> just a Regex?
>
> Join me on a wild ride exploring amazing Game of Life patterns, unusual Regex
> techniques, Turing Completeness, programatically generating complex Regexes
> with Ruby, and what all this means for ou understanding of what a Regex can
> do.

## Afterwards

The zoom call will stay open after the talks are finished for a little bit if
attendees want to chat for a while. It's not as good as shouting across a table
at the Singer Tavern, but we make do with what we can. The speakers may hang out
so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting. If you've
got any ideas for something better, then please do let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

The August 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of August*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

note that **the zoom meeting url is only sent to registered attendees, so please
do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

The zoom call will stay open after the talks are finished for a little bit if
attendees want to chat for a while. It's not as good as shouting across a table
at the Singer Tavern, but we make do with what we can. The speakers may hang out
so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting. If you've
got any ideas for something better, then please do let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

## Registration {#aug21registration}

Prior to attending you **must** familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying particular attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we are only tiny flat moving images like prisoners in the
Phantom Zone.

### Secure your place

Thanks to capitalism we can only host a limited number of people in our Zoom
meetings, so **[you need to register via eventbrite][aug2021-eventbrite]**. The
link to the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of
the meeting, around about 6pm. Keep an eye out for the email and check your spam
just in case.

Give yourself a head-start by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download) (lol, as if you don't already have it).

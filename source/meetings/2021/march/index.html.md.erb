The March 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of March*, from
_6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_), taking place once again in
our virtual home. This will mark a full year of running LRUG remotely. Wild
times.

[Full registration details are given below](#mar21registration). Please remember
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who have
registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got two talks this month, but as ever, we always need more, from April
onwards. Email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org) and we will do our very
best to nurture your seed of inspiration into a healthy plant of...
content.

## Afterwards

We're all at home so there's no post-meeting pub meetup, however a few
attendees often hang around on in the zoom call after the talks are over.
It's a pale-shadow of the pub meetup, so if you have some ideas about
doing something better do get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#mar21registration}

Prior to attending you _must_ familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we are all just little silent video characters.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the meeting so
**[you need to register via eventbrite][mar2021-eventbrite]**. The link to the
zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of the
meeting, around 6pm. Keep an eye out for the email and check your spam just in
case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

The June 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Wednesday the 9th of June*, from... wait, what? **Wednesday**?!

Yes, that's right. This month, weâ€™re doing something a **little different** and joining up with many of the other European Ruby user groups (including our good friends in [NWRug](https://nwrug.org), [Shrug](https://shrug.org), [SW Ruby](https://www.meetup.com/south-west-ruby/) and [ScotRuby](https://scotrug.org)) to have a sort-of mini Rails-Conf.

The details are now available at [the EMEA on Rails site](https://www.emeaonrails.com) and we will keep you updated as we find out more about how to join in on the day. You can also [follow the event on Twitter](https://twitter.com/emeaonrails). The event will run through the afternoon and early evening (the schedule showing `GMT + 1` is the same as `BST`, our current timezone), and you'll be free to dip in and out as your own schedule allows.

This is all a bit of an experiment, but hopefully it will be a fun opportunity to interact with some other user groups, and take a little bit more advantage of the remote-ness of our circumstances at the moment. In July, we'll be back to our regular second-Monday meetups.

Hopefully see you then!

The February 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of February*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The online nature
of our little gathering continues.

[Full registration details are given below](#feb21registration), but do
note that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, because we have limited places, so please do it.**

## Agenda

It's our annual ⚡️lightning⚡️ talks event.  All short talks, all the
time.  As ever, we're still looking for volunteers (we have room for up to
eight of you), so get in touch [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if
you've got something to say.

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

The best we can do at the moment is promise that a few of us will hang out
on the zoom call after all the talks are done to blather on for a bit.
It's a poor substitute for actually meeting up in person, but we'll
persevere with it.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach,
then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#feb21registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we are all in our own little bubbles.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the
meeting so **[you need to register via eventbrite][feb2021-eventbrite]**.
The link to the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on
the day of the meeting, around about 6pm. Keep an eye out for the email
and check your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

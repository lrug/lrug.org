The February 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of February*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The online nature
of our little gathering continues.

[Full registration details are given below](#feb21registration), but do
note that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, because we have limited places, so please do it.**

## Agenda

It's our annual ⚡️lightning⚡️ talks event.  All short talks, all the
time.  As ever, we're still looking for volunteers (we have room for up to
eight of you), so get in touch [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if
you've got something to say.

### An intro to Bridgetown: A static site generator for the modern JAMStack era.

[Ayush Newatia](https://binarysolo.chapter24.blog):

> [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) is a new Ruby-powered static
> site generator that was forked from Jekyll 4.1. It has a focus on modern
> ideas and includes Webpack as a first-class citizen. In this talk I'll
> give a demo of what differentiates Bridgetown from Jekyll and some of
> its best features; followed by a short Q&A.

### The Path(name) of least resistance

[Fred Cheung](https://twitter.com/fglc2):

> Ruby has many classes that deal with files, paths or directories, but
> one that often doesn't get enough credit is
> [Pathname](https://github.com/ruby/pathname). Pathname unifies the other
> pretenders to the throne with a consistent, rubyish interface that is a
> joy to work with.

### Are we parallel yet? A first look at Ruby Ractors

[Lorenzo Barasti](https://twitter.com/lbarasti):

> A speedrun through actor-based concurrency, the Ractor API and the
> future of parallel applications in Ruby.

### Uncovering some ruby magic in `awesome_print`

[Mark Burns](https://github.com/markburns):

> `ap 1.methods` takes an `Array` of `Symbol`s as input and outputs
> details it shouldn't know about the methods themselves. `ap
> 1.methods.dup` has the same behaviour, but `ap
> 1.methods.take(1.methods.length)` does not. I will peer into the magic
> and divulge its secrets.

### Taking Rails Offline

[Mike Rogers](https://twitter.com/mikerogers0):

> Networks are unreliable & drop out all the time! Lets make our apps more
> resilient to that!

{::coverage year="2021" month="february" talk="taking-rails-offline" /}

## Afterwards

The best we can do at the moment is promise that a few of us will hang out
on the zoom call after all the talks are done to blather on for a bit.
It's a poor substitute for actually meeting up in person, but we'll
persevere with it.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach,
then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#feb21registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of

the day of the meeting, around about 6pm. Keep an eye out for the email
and check your spam just in case.

[Full registration details are given below](#may21registration), note
that **the zoom meeting url is only sent to registered attendees, so
please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

So far there's one talk on the agenda, but we're always looking for me so
please email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org) if your interested in
sharing a talk with us.

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

We leave the zoom call running after the talks are over for as long as our
collective rumbling stomachs can handle.  Why not stick around and chat
with the handful of attendees who also don't have zoom fatigue yet. If
you've got any ideas for something better let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#may21registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we are all in our own little bubbles.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the
meeting so **[you need to register via eventbrite][may2021-eventbrite]**.
The link to the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on
the day of the meeting, around about 6pm. Keep an eye out for the email
and check your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

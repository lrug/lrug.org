## Agenda

So far there's one talk on the agenda, but we're always looking for me so
please email [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org) if your interested in
sharing a talk with us.

### Your fortified cookie jar: Demystifying cookie security in Rails

[Ayush Newatia](https://binarysolo.chapter24.blog) says:

> You may have heard that cookie security is hard with the need to worry
> special flags and encryption. Actually, Ruby on Rails makes it super
> simple to securely store data in cookies. In this talk I'll explain the
> different types of cookies supported by Rails and what Rails does under
> the hood to secure the data they contain.

### Is this feature a waste of time?

[Tom Lord](https://github.com/tom-lord) says:

> Sometimes a new feature may be objectively worthwhile; but often one
> might be left wondering “Does this actually make our product better?”,
> or “Is this making the business more money?”.
>
> In this talk, I will explore the virtues of defining North Star metrics,
> AB testing product variations to statistical significance, and using
> funnel analysis to quantify a feature's value.

## Afterwards

We leave the zoom call running after the talks are over for as long as our
collective rumbling stomachs can handle.  Why not stick around and chat
with the handful of attendees who also don't have zoom fatigue yet. If
you've got any ideas for something better let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

The September 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on _Monday the 13th of September_,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#sep21registration), and please do
note that **the zoom meeting url is only sent to registered attendees, so please
do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

### How to use flamegraphs to find performance problems

Jade Dickinson will be running an interactive workshop:

> Slow Ruby code can be a puzzle, but it doesn’t have to be that way. In this
> talk you will see how fun it can be to use flamegraphs to find performance
> problems. You’ll enjoy this talk if you know you have slow areas in your
> Ruby application\*, and would like to learn how to find the code responsible.

## Afterwards

The zoom call will stay open after the talks are finished for a little bit if
attendees want to chat for a while. It's not as good as shouting across a table
at the Singer Tavern, but we make do with what we can. The speakers may hang out
so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting. If you've
got any ideas for something better, then please do let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

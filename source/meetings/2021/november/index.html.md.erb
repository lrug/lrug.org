## Agenda

### Failing better w/ Load Shedding & Deadline Propagation across services

[Christian Gregg](https://twitter.com/CGA1123) says:

> As services start to split off from your majestic monolith, cascading
> failures as a single service or endpoint slows down can become a
> recurring problem which very quickly can lead to service unavailability.
> Implementing load-shedding and deadline propagation across your services
> is a technique which can help you provide a more resilient service to
> your customers. This talk will introduce some of the concepts explored
> in [CGA1123/loadshedding-experiment-ruby](https://github.com/CGA1123/loadshedding-experiment-ruby)
> & [CGA1123/shed](https://github.com/CGA1123/shed).

### Why Rails is still relevant for startups in 2021

[Chris Parsons](https://twitter.com/chrismdp) says:

> With the rise of single page JavaScript apps, lo-code, and mobile-first,
> is Rails consigned to the legacy dustbin of frameworks last cool in
> 2008? The answer is emphatically “no” - Rails is as relevant as ever for
> startups in 2021. Chris will talk about how Rails has supercharged the
> early stage of his new startup, LollipopAI, and how Rails gave them
> quick experiments, good-enough domain modelling and tooling that just
> works.

### Service Objects and Domain objects differences

[Patricia Cupueran](https://twitter.com/pa1809ty) says:

> Understanding what a service and domain objects are. Distinguishing the
> difference between procedures and objects. Why using service objects is
> a bad idea. Advantages of using modules, concerns and PORO's instead of
> service objects.

## Afterwards

It's been nearly 2 years of this and we still haven't worked out a good
replacement for hanging out in the pub after the meeting.  That said we
leave the zoom call running for a little while after the talks for
folk to chat.  We encourage the speakers to hang around too if they can,
so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting, or
that you felt were too niche to share with the wider group.  If you've got
any ideas for something better, then please do let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

## Registration {#nov21registration}

Prior to attending you **must** familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying particular attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we float on screens like so many tiny programming postage stamps.

### Secure your place

Our Zoom meetings are artificially constrained by our miserly purses, so
**[you need to register via eventbrite][nov2021-eventbrite]** to secure a
place. We only send the link to the zoom meeting to people who have
registered. It goes out around about 6pm on the day of the meeting, so
keep an eye out for it and check your spam just in case.

Give yourself a head-start by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download) (lol, as if you don't already have it).

The February 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 21st of February*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#feb22registration), but do
note that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, because we have limited places, so please do it.**

## Agenda

It's our annual ⚡️lightning⚡️ talks event.  All short talks, all the
time.  As ever, we're still looking for volunteers (we have room for up to
eight of you), so get in touch [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), if
you've got something to say.


### Javascript in Rails: A New Hope

[Frederick Cheung](https://twitter.com/fglc2):

> Tired of slow webpack builds and daunting configuration files?
> Find out how the new css-bundling and js-bundling gems can roll back the years
> and make javascript in rails fast and simple again.

### Getting past enemy images

[Pablo Dejuan](https://pablo.pm):

> Enemy images hinder our communication with people when we need them
> the most: to agree with another colleague over a code review, to interview
> a third party, to have an important conversation with our boss or direct
> report (technical or non-technical topic).
> In this talk we will raise awareness and cover one way of overcoming the
> initial enemy image to get a better outcome for us and our team.

### The tale of the 60+ second page loads

[Jared Turner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredlt/):

> A monstrous mystery and a head-scratching hunt. Follow along to discover
> why, just why, is that darn page so slow!?

### Your talk here

Got something to say? Get in touch! [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org)

## Afterwards

The best we can do at the moment is promise that a few of us will hang out
on the zoom call after all the talks are done to blather on for a bit.
It's a poor substitute for actually meeting up in person, but we'll
persevere with it.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach,
then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#feb22registration}

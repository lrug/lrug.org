## Agenda

### Heaping on the Complexity

[Matt Valentine-House](https://ruby.social/@eightbitraptor) says:

> Join me on a journey through Ruby's Garbage Collector!
> 
> In this talk I'll teach you some of the details about how the Ruby
> interpreter manages memory. I'll introduce a project my team and I are
> working on that aims to make Ruby faster by improving its memory
> efficiency, and then we'll talk about how our implementation broke
> Garbage Collection.

> After that we'll go on a journey together, through some weeds, and
> taking a few bad turns until we finally emerge with a few PR's that
> not only Fix GC, but make our project better too.

###  What does "high priority" mean? The secret to happy queues

[Daniel Magliola](https://mobile.twitter.com/dmagliola)

> Like most web applications, you run important jobs in the background. And
> today, some of your urgent jobs are running late. Again. No matter how many
> changes you make to how you enqueue and run your jobs, the problem keeps
> happening. The good news is you're not alone. Most teams struggle with this
> problem, try more or less the same solutions, and have roughly the same
> result. In the end, it all boils down to one thing: keeping latency low. In
> this talk I will present a latency-focused approach to managing your queues
> reliably, keeping your jobs flowing and your users happy. 

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#dec22registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all

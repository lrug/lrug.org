The October 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of October*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

**👪 in person meeting alert 👪**

September was a success, and we have a willing venue host, so we're
having another in person event. This time we're being hosted by the
lovely folk at [Cleo](https://meetcleo.com) in [their
offices][cleo-venue], on Shoreditch High St. [Full venue and registration
details are given below](#oct22registration).


## Agenda

### How to be completely ignorant

[Paul Battley](https://po-ru.com) says:

> How much does a bit of code need to know to do its job? I'll show how I
> transformed a bit of complicated, untested, flaky, and poorly understood code
> into something pleasant to deal with and easy to test by applying the
> principle of making it know as little as possible.

### The long road to ruby 3 vs. the short road to ruby 3.1

[Murray Steele](https://twitter.com/hlame) says:

> I'll share how the team at [Cleo](https://www.meetcleo.com/)
> meticulously planned and delivered the upgrade to ruby 3.0 on our rails
> app so smoothly that we became drunk on our own competence and totally
> messed up our upgrade to ruby 3.1 the following week.  A rare talk
> where you will learn some best _and_ worst practices.

## Afterwards

After the talks we'll avoid outstaying our welcome with our hosts and move on to a local pub to grab some food and drinks and to talk over what we've heard from our speakers.

The October 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of October*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

**ðŸ‘ª in person meeting alert ðŸ‘ª**

September was a success, and we have a willing venue host, so we're
having another in person event. This time we're being hosted by the
lovely folk at [Cleo](https://meetcleo.com) in [their
offices][cleo-venue], on Shoreditch High St. [Full venue and registration
details are given below](#oct22registration).


## Agenda

### How to be completely ignorant

[Paul Battley](https://po-ru.com) says:

> How much does a bit of code need to know to do its job? I'll show how I
> transformed a bit of complicated, untested, flaky, and poorly understood code
> into something pleasant to deal with and easy to test by applying the
> principle of making it know as little as possible.

## Afterwards

After the talks we'll avoid outstaying our welcome with our hosts and move on to a local pub to grab some food and drinks and to talk over what we've heard from our speakers.

## Venue & Registration {#oct22registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we are all in our own little bubbles.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via eventbrite][october2022-eventbrite]**.

The venue has a hard limit of 60 people. If you register and realise you

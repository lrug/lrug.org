**ðŸ‘ª in person meeting alert ðŸ‘ª**

For the first time since March 2020 we're having an in person event. The

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.  We'll post details of the pub shortly, once Funding Circle tell us which is the best one to go to!

## Venue & Registration {#sep22registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

The September 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of
September*, from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

**ðŸ‘ª in person meeting alert ðŸ‘ª**

For the first time since March 2020 we're having an in person event. The
lovely folk at [Funding Circle](https://fundingcircle.com) are hosting us
in [their offices][fc-venue], on Queen Victoria St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#sep22registration).

## Agenda

### How music works, using Ruby

[Thijs Cadier](https://twitter.com/thijsc) says:

> That strange phenomenon where air molecules bounce against each other in a way that somehow comforts you, makes you cry, or makes you dance all night: music. Since the advent of recorded audio, a musician doesn't even need to be present anymore for this to happen (which makes putting "I will always love you" on repeat a little less awkward).
>
> Musicians and sound engineers have found many ways of creating music, and making music sound good when played from a record. Some of their methods have become industry staples used on every recording released today.
>
> Let's look at what they do and reproduce some of their methods in Ruby!

### Building a Mortgage Lender at Generation Home

[AndrÃ© Barbosa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrebarbosaie/) says:

> Itâ€™s not often that you hear about a startup doings things differently in the mortgages world. And thereâ€™s some good reasons for it, the cost of entry is super high!
>
> Itâ€™s not just funding and regulations either. You also need to back it up with the right technology and tools to manage a highly complex business where mistakes can be very costly. On top of that, startups need to move fast to out-innovate the incumbents with only a fraction of the resources.
>
> At Generation Home Ruby has been a catalyst to help us deliver a product weâ€™re proud of in a short time-scale. Weâ€™ll talk about some of the challenges we faced early on, how Ruby, Rails and the whole ecosystem helped us deliver and what still lays ahead of us.

### Fixing flaky tests, using RSpec's `--seed` option

[Shen Sat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shen-sat) says:

> Fixing a flaky test in the build pipeline of your application often
> requires first replicating the failing test locally. I'm going to show you
> how I used RSpec's `--seed` to help me do this for a flaky test I was
> recently grappling with, and how it led led me to a fix âœ¨

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.  We'll post details of the pub shortly, once Funding Circle tell us which is the best one to go to!

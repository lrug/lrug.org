The July 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 11th of July*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#july22registration), but do
note that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who

## Agenda

### Building a Mortgage Lender at Generation Home

[André Barbosa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrebarbosaie/) says:

> It’s not often that you hear about a startup doings things differently in the mortgages world. And there’s some good reasons for it, the cost of entry is super high!
>
> It’s not just funding and regulations either. You also need to back it up with the right technology and tools to manage a highly complex business where mistakes can be very costly. On top of that, startups need to move fast to out-innovate the incumbents with only a fraction of the resources.
>
> At Generation Home Ruby has been a catalyst to help us deliver a product we’re proud of in a short time-scale. We’ll talk about some of the challenges we faced early on, how Ruby, Rails and the whole ecosystem helped us deliver and what still lays ahead of us.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we can't quite replicate the convivial atmosphere of hanging out in a local pub with your fellow attendees, but we do leave the zoom call running to let those interested chat for a while.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach, then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

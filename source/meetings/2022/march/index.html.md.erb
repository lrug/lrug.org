The March 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of March*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#mar22registration), but do
note that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, because we have limited places, so please do it.**

## Agenda

### Running full builds after merging? ðŸ¥±: Ship faster with git tree based caching

[Christian Gregg](https://github.com/CGA1123) says:


> Fast deploy pipelines are an important facet of a fast moving
> engineering team; allowing you to ship smaller, safer units of value to
> production, [faster](https://xkcd.com/303/), and more often.
>
> In this talk we'll be covering how using [git tree
> objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#_tree_objects)
> can allow you to run CI less or potentially not at all (in a not
> scary manner :) after merging your changes into your default branch,
> allowing you to get straight to deploying! ðŸš‚
>
> In cases where your team can precompile deployment artefacts your
> changes could make it into production in under 60s. If your team uses
> Heroku or Buildpacks to deploy your code, I'll point you to
> [some](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/build-an-app/)
> [tricks](https://github.com/CGA1123/slugcmplr) to help you do just that
> by detaching building and releasing your application to production!

### The Browser Environment - A Systems Programmer's Perspective

[Eleanor McHugh](http://slideshare.net/feyeleanor) says:

> A quirky introduction to writing realtime web systems with Sinatra as
> the backend. The highlight will be WebSockets but there'll also be
> coverage of DOM manipulation, AJAX/fetch, and timer events.

## Afterwards

After the formal part of the meeting, if you want to keep on LRUGging a
handful of us usually stay on the zoom call for a bit of a chat. It's not
quite the same as hanging out together IRL, but it's better than nothing
while things remain pandemic-y. If you have some ideas about an
alternative approach, then let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

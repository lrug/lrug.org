## Agenda

### Using React in a Ruby Project to Dynamically Generate PDF Documents

[Panos Matsinopoulos](https://getlavanda.com) says:


> Fjust needs to be a couple of sentences really, not a
> full abstract. We use markdown so feel free to format it or embed links for
> the writeup.
> 
> In the Ruby world, we traditionally address the PDF generation problem
> using gems like [Prawn](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn) and [PDFKit](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit)
> or libraries like [whtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).
> 
> Recently, in one of our Ruby on Rails projects in which we 
> wanted to generate PDF documents for invoices, we decided to use
> another programming language and technology: React and AWS Lambda.
> 
> In this talk, we will be covering how we did it, what were the challenges
> and what pros and cons over the incumbent tools for Ruby.

### A parse parse pitch: using JSON and custom parsers to create efficient flexible data structures.

[Eleanor McHugh](http://slideshare.net/feyeleanor) says:

> JSON and custom parsers let you do neat things like: 
> complex pricing, map data to 3D models, auto generate images…

## Afterwards

After the formal part of the meeting, if you want to keep on LRUGging a
handful of us usually stay on the zoom call for a bit of a chat. It's not
quite the same as hanging out together IRL, but it's better than nothing
while things remain pandemic-y. If you have some ideas about an
alternative approach, then let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#apr22registration}

The May 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of May*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#may22registration), but do
note that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, because we have limited places, so please do it.**

## Agenda

### Mining a gem: how to safely discover, extract and share useful code from your Rails app

[Duncan Brown](https://github.com/duncanjbrown) says:

> We recently extracted a [gem for talking to Google BigQuery](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/dfe-analytics)
> from 5 different Rails applications at the Department for Education
> I'll talk through the process of pulling the code out, how to test gems
> that work with Rails, figuring out how to deal with divergence among
> existing implementations of the same functionality, and how we're
> driving adoption of internal open source at DfE.

### [GOV.UK][]’s response to COVID-19

[Leena Gupte](https://twitter.com/LeenaG) and [Rosa Fox](https://twitter.com/rosaemerald) say:

> Leena and Rosa have been Senior Developers/Tech Leads on the [GOV.UK][]
> Coronavirus team. The team’s work began in March 2020 when a service
> they built over a weekend had nearly 50,000 registrations on the day it
> launched. Two years later, after building lots more services (using
> Ruby… of course) and serving millions of users, the [GOV.UK][]
> Coronavirus team finally disbanded.
>
> Rosa and Leena will take LRUG through a timeline of [GOV.UK][]’s
> response to the pandemic. We will discuss what we delivered, our
> successes, failures and how the team supported each other to cope. We
> will share how Ruby/Rails and tools such as the [GOV.UK][] Design System
> enabled us to build and deploy critical services at pace.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we can't quite replicate the convivial atmosphere of hanging out in a local pub with your fellow attendees, but we do leave the zoom call running to let those interested chat for a while.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach, then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#may22registration}

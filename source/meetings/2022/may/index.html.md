## Agenda

{::coverage year="2022" month="may" talk="" /}

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we can't quite replicate the convivial atmosphere of hanging out in a local pub with your fellow attendees, but we do leave the zoom call running to let those interested chat for a while.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach, then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#may22registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we are all in our own little bubbles.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the
meeting so **[you need to register via eventbrite][may2022-eventbrite]**.
The link to the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on
the day of the meeting, around about 6pm. Keep an eye out for the email
and check your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

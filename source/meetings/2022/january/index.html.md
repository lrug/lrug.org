The January 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of January*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  Still online.

[Full registration details are given below](#jan22registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

This month, we have decided to offer something different: a pub quiz about Ruby,
Ruby on Rails, and more.

### LRUG Pub quiz

> Are you proud of your knowledge of Ruby and Ruby on Rails? Invite your
> friends, and win bragging rights. Or simply invite them and enjoy spending
> time with them.

The quiz will have 4 categories, and each category will have between 20 and 30
questions. The 4 categories are:

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- General computing
- London

{::coverage year="2022" month="january" talk="pub-quiz" /}

## Afterwards

It's been nearly 2 years of this and we still haven't worked out a good
replacement for hanging out in the pub after the meeting. That said we
leave the zoom call running for a little while after the talks for
folk to chat. We encourage the speakers to hang around too if they can,
so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting, or
that you felt were too niche to share with the wider group. If you've got
any ideas for something better, then please do let us know at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org). Thanks!

## Registration {#jan22registration}

Prior to attending you **must** familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying particular attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though we float on screens like so many tiny programming postage stamps.

### Secure your place

Our Zoom meetings are artificially constrained by our miserly purses, so
**[you need to register via eventbrite][jan2022-eventbrite]** to secure a
place. We only send the link to the zoom meeting to people who have
registered. It goes out around about 6pm on the day of the meeting, so
keep an eye out for it and check your spam just in case.

Give yourself a head-start by [downloading the zoom
client](https://zoom.us/support/download) (lol, as if you don't already have it).

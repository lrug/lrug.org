## Agenda

### Low overhead Ruby profiling and tracing with rbperf

[Javier Honduvilla Coto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javierhonduco/) says:

> Understanding our applications' performance can be tricky. Some of the readily available performance tools introduce a big overhead which makes them not suitable for use in production environments, where in many cases, it's the best place to troubleshoot performance issues.
>
> [rbperf](https://github.com/javierhonduco/rbperf/) is a low-overhead on-CPU profiler and tracer that is suitable for usage in production environments. It doesn't require the application under investigation to be restarted or disturbed in any way.
>
> We will discuss some of the tradeoffs in its design, its architecture, the features that make it unique, as well as its limitations compared to other tools. We will also take a look at how the Ruby stack is laid out in memory and the role BPF plays in rbperf.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we can't quite replicate the convivial atmosphere of hanging out in a local pub with your fellow attendees, but we do leave the zoom call running to let those interested chat for a while.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach, then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

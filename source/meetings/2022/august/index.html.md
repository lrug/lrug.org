The August 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of August*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

[Full registration details are given below](#august22registration), but do
note that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, because we have limited places, so please do it.**

## Agenda

### rbperf: Understanding Ruby with BPF

[Javier Honduvilla Coto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrebarbosaie) says:

> Was thinking to talk about some CRuby internal details, how the stack is laid out under the hood, and what is needed to be able to implement
> something like rbperf, as well as its architecture and the features that make it unique (very low-overhead, 'true' on-CPU profiling, system call
> tracing, no need to restart the Ruby process, etc) as well as it's limitations compared to other profilers (Linux-only, some BPF limitations
> that we can discuss, and others).

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we can't quite replicate the convivial atmosphere of hanging out in a local pub with your fellow attendees, but we do leave the zoom call running to let those interested chat for a while.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach, then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

The November 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of
November*, from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

**👪 in person meeting alert 👪**

In-person seems to be working out, so we're doing it again.  This time the lovely folks at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/) are hosting us
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#nov22registration).

## Agenda

### Data Indexing with RGB (Ruby, Graphs and Bitmaps)

[Benji Lewis](https://twitter.com/benjilewis) (also [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benji-lewis-ct)) says:

> In this talk, we will go on a journey through Zappi’s data history and how
> we are using Ruby, a graph database, and a bitmap store to build a unique
> data engine. A journey that starts with the problem of a disconnected data
> set and serialised data frames, and ends with the solution of an in-memory
> index.
>
> We will explore how we used RedisGraph to model the relationships in our
> data, connecting semantically equal nodes. Then delve into how a query
> layer was used to index a bitmap store and, in turn, led to us being able
> to interrogate our entire dataset orders of magnitude faster than before.

### `ruby/debug` - The best investment for your productivity

[Stan Lo](https://twitter.com/_st0012) says:

> In this talk, I will demonstrate 3 powerful debugging techniques using Ruby's new debugger [`ruby/debug`](https://github.com/ruby/debug):
>
> * Step-debugging
> * Frame navigation
> * Breakpoint commands
>
> By using them together, we can reduce unnecessary context switching and make our debugging sessions more efficient. You will also learn more about `ruby/debug` while we walk through these techniques with its commands and console.
>
> And finally, I will show you how to level up our productivity even further by automating debugging steps using `ruby/debug`'s scriptable breakpoints.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

The November 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of
November*, from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

**👪 in person meeting alert 👪**

In-person seems to be working out, so we're doing it again.  This time the lovely folks at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/) are hosting us
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#nov22registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#nov22registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

The November 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of
November*, from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).

**ðŸ‘ª in person meeting alert ðŸ‘ª**

In-person seems to be working out, so we're doing it again.  This time the lovely folks at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/) are hosting us
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#nov22registration).

## Agenda

### Data Indexing with RGB (Ruby, Graphs and Bitmaps)

[Benji Lewis](https://twitter.com/benjilewis) (also [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benji-lewis-ct)) says:

> In this talk, we will go on a journey through Zappiâ€™s data history and how
> we are using Ruby, a graph database, and a bitmap store to build a unique
> data engine. A journey that starts with the problem of a disconnected data
> set and serialised data frames, and ends with the solution of an in-memory
> index.
>
> We will explore how we used RedisGraph to model the relationships in our
> data, connecting semantically equal nodes. Then delve into how a query
> layer was used to index a bitmap store and, in turn, led to us being able
> to interrogate our entire dataset orders of magnitude faster than before.

### `ruby/debug` - The best investment for your productivity

[Stan Lo](https://twitter.com/_st0012) says:

> In this talk, I will demonstrate 3 powerful debugging techniques using Ruby's new debugger [`ruby/debug`](https://github.com/ruby/debug):
>
> * Step-debugging
> * Frame navigation
> * Breakpoint commands
>
> By using them together, we can reduce unnecessary context switching and make our debugging sessions more efficient. You will also learn more about `ruby/debug` while we walk through these techniques with its commands and console.
>
> And finally, I will show you how to level up our productivity even further by automating debugging steps using `ruby/debug`'s scriptable breakpoints.

### Keeping developers happy with a fast CI

[Christian Bruckmayer](https://twitter.com/bruckmayer) says:

> When talking about performance, most developers think application speed,
> faster algorithms or better data structures. But what about your test
> suite? CI time is developer waiting time!
>
> At Shopify we have more than 170,000 Ruby tests and we add 30,000 more
> annually. The sheer amount of tests and their growth requires some
> aggressive methods. We will illustrate some of our techniques including
> monitoring, test selection, timeouts and the 80/20 rule. If you have
> experience in writing tests and want to learn tricks on how to speed up
> your test suite, this talk is for you!

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

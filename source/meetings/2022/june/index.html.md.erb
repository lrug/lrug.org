## Agenda

### Get your PRs merged, rebasing like a Pro

[Daniel Magliola](https://twitter.com/dmagliola) says:

> You have a complex PR to submit. You've tried to keep it small, but sadly
> you need to make many different changes all at once. Getting there took a
> lot of effort and your branch has more than 30 commits with fixes and
> reverting of dead ends.
>
> You know reviewing this will be a nightmare for your colleagues, and more
> importantly, it will be almost impossible for someone in the future to
> understand what happened if they ever look at the history.
>
> In this talk we will look at how Git branches work, and how to manicure
> them using Rebase to build a commit history your colleagues will love you
> for.

### The messy middle â€“ 5 Software Engineering lessons from a 5 years startup journey

[Alfredo Motta](https://twitter.com/mottalrd) says:

> These are some of the lessons that I have learned over my 5 years at a
> Fintech startup that went from 0 to 100k customers and grew the team from 4
> to 50 people. I will present some of the software architecture tradeoffs I
> have been presented with and I am still puzzled about today.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we can't quite replicate the convivial atmosphere of hanging out in a local pub with your fellow attendees, but we do leave the zoom call running to let those interested chat for a while.  If you have some ideas about an alternative approach, then let us know at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

The December 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of December*, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (talks start at 6:30pm).

### Venue reminder

[Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com) are our hosts and have recently moved to [Code Node](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) a great new venue between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations.  [Full venue and registration details are given below](#dec15registration).

Agenda
------

### Festive `CodeWarsJam`

[Sam Joseph](https://github.com/tansaku) is going to lead us through a practical exercise he calls "CodeWarsJam".  He describes it as follows:

> A CodeWarsJam is a session where small teams of coders work on the same coding
> problem together.  The problems are usually relatively simple and can be
> reviewed as a group every 20 minutes or so.  Recently at
> [MakersAcademy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) we've had great fun with
> CodeWarsJams, where we take coding kata from [http://codewars.com](http://codewars.com)
> and use them to run a CodeWarsJam.  CodeWarsJam is great because when you
> solve a problem you get to see all the other variant solutions that others
> have coded, sorted by popularity.  Come join the festive coding fun as LRUG's
> first CodeWarsJam!

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7566-london-ruby-usergroup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7566-london-ruby-usergroup).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-december/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

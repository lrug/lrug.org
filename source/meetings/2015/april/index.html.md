The April 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 13th of April*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#apr15registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Un-artificial Intelligence: How People Learn

[Melinda Seckington](https://missgeeky.com/) says:

> Most developers are familiar with the basics of AI: how do you make a
> computer, an algorithm, a system learn something? What most don't
> realize though is that the same principles are applied to people. This
> talk looks at the theory behind how people learn, and maps it to real
> life examples of how specifically developers learn.

### The shiny new mongo gem

[Emily Stolfo](https://twitter.com/emstolfo) is visiting from Berlin to tell us all about writing the new ruby driver for MongoDB:

> The Ruby team at MongoDB spent the last year building a new driver
> -- [the mongo gem](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver) --
> that was released a few weeks ago. Emily is going to talk about how
> they built the driver, its design, and why its availability is
> so exciting for the Rails and Ruby community.
>
> For reference, an article announcing the release: [shar.es/1g0PFK](http://shar.es/1g0PFK)
>
> [MongoDB 3.0](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/3.0/) was also released a few weeks ago and she'll talk a bit
> about what makes this version so monumental and why you should try
> it out.

## Pub

The formal talks-and-speakers-based part of the meeting ends around 8pm, after which we make the short trip to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to continue the event.  Most of the attendees and speakers are usually here so it's a great chance to find out what's going on in the LRUG community, or to catch up with or make some new friends.  Attendance of the talks is not a prerequisite for coming to the pub, so please do come along!

---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7113-un-artificial-intelligence-and-the-new-mongodb-ruby-driver-2-point-0).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7113-un-artificial-intelligence-and-the-new-mongodb-ruby-driver-2-point-0).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-april/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

The July 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 13th of July*, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (talks start at 6:30pm).

### Host & venue change!

Our usual hosts are unavailable for this meeting.  Thankfully [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and [Altmetric](http://www.altmetric.com) stepped forward to host us in a venue in their office complex.

This venue has strict 100 person capacity and we require attendees to register in advance (for free).  <a href="#jul15registration">Full venue and registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### LEARNING HOW TO LEARN RUBY (and rails, and sinatra, and ...)

[Sam Joseph](https://github.com/tansaku) says:

> At Makers Academy we coach students through the process of learning
> Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, JQuery and Angular over the course of
> 12 weeks.  Students range in age from 18 to 60, although the majority
> are in their late 20s or early 30s, already have university degrees
> (often a humanities subject) and have spent 5+ years in the workplace
> doing sales, marketing, design, management or some other relatively
> non-technical role.  The majority of students have also had almost no
> programming experience prior to their preparation for the interview and
> selection process that they must go through to get on the course.  In
> this talk I will explore what makes a 12 week intensive bootcamp tick,
> and the particular challenges the students face with learning Ruby and
> JavaScript.

### Flaky tests & Capybara best practices

[Karlotcha Hoa](https://github.com/Karlotcha) says:

> One of the main purposes of testing is to enable us to trust the
> performance of our code in an automated way. Unfortunately, several
> problems often arise with automated tests. One common and particularly
> annoying problem that we began experiencing in our codebase was
> flakiness.
>
> In this talk, I will discuss common problems that may cause this issue,
> and some solutions we discovered based on our own experience at
> SimplyBusiness.


## Pub

The talks will end at 8pm and we'll head to [The Fellow](http://www.geronimo-inns.co.uk/london-the-fellow) shortly after.  We've reserved the entire first floor, so if you can't make the talks but want to hang out with some rubyists afterwards, head on over and climb the stairs to say "hi".

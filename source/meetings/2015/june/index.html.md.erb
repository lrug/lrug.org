The June 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of June*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#jun15registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Redis is the answer, what's the question?

[Garry Shutler](http://gshutler.com) says:

> There are very few things that are part of my go-to toolbox, but Redis
> is one of those things. I don't think there's a better, more flexible
> piece of infrastructure you can have at your disposal.
>
> I'll cover the very basics of using Redis and general patterns that you
> can use within your own systems. I'll also share some concrete examples
> of what we've used it for at Cronofy.

### Ruby Magic

> As a child, [Andrew McDonough](http://twitter.com/andrewmcdonough) loved
> magic.  One of the best Christmas presents he ever received was a magic
> set.  As an adult, Andrew prefers to perform magic using Ruby.  In this
> talk, he will attempt an array of traditional magic tricks, using only
> [IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell).

### Test Bisection with RSpec

[Simon Coffey](https://twitter.com/urbanautomaton) says:

> I'll talk about a useful technique for debugging order-dependent test
> failures, and introduce an upcoming feature in RSpec that automates it.

## Pub

All those talks will take us to about 8pm, after which we leave Skills Matter's offices and head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to continue the meeting.  While we ask you to [register for the talks](#jun15registration), there's no need to do so for this pub part; feel free to turn up even if you don't make it for the talks.

## Registration {#jun15registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7216-lrug-june-2015-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7216-lrug-june-2015-meetup).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-june/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

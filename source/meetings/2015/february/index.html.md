### Bath Ruby Conf tickets giveaway

{::sponsor name="Team Prime" size="main" /}

{::sponsor name="Bath Ruby Conference 2015" size="main" /}

Thanks to the nice folks at [Team Prime](http://www.team-prime.com/) and [Bath Ruby](http://2015.bathruby.org) we are able to provide 4 people with free tickets and a £70 allowance (enough to cover return train travel from London).  The tickets are available to LRUG members that wouldn't otherwise be able to attend.  The deadline to put your name forward for a ticket is *midnight* on *Sunday 8th, February 2014*.  If more than 4 people request the tickets a draw will be held privately to select the winners.  The recipients of the tickets will not be publicly announced, but we'll thank Team Prime and the Bath Ruby Conf organisers at the start of the meeting.

## Pub

All those talks are bound to generate some thoughts we'd like to discuss afterwards.  So we cross Goswell Road and head down to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to have those discussions in a more informal setting.  If you didn't make it for the talks then do feel free to turn up just for this bit.

## Registration {#feb15registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6984-lrug-lightening-talks-evening).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6984-lrug-lightening-talks-evening).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-february/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

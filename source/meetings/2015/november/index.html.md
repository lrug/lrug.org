The November 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of November*, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (talks start at 6:30pm).

### Venue reminder

[Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com) continue to host us, but do remember that they've moved.  We're at [Code Node](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations.  [Full venue and registration details are given below](#nov15registration).

Agenda
------

### Hack like a journalist

[Scott Matthewman](https://twitter.com/scottm) says:

> News reporters are trained in techniques to produce stories that are concise,
> well structured, easy to follow and with a consistent house style. How can
> those same techniques help us write better code?

### Leveraging immutability in Ruby

[Lorenzo Barasti](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/lorenzo-barasti/5a/918/685) says:

> Why should we care about using immutable objects in our code? What does
> functional programming have to do with immutability? How do we approach
> immutability when the frameworks and libraries we use seem to go a different
> direction?
>
> We'll try to answer these questions by looking at the ideas behind the
> implementation of some immutable data structure.

### No-Man’s Land - Finding peace at the border of art and tech

[Kevin Monk](https://twitter.com/KevinMonk) and [Simon Sharville](http://www.simonsharville.co.uk/) :

> However good the underlying tech, ugly applications discourage users, pretty
> ones will attract them. A gulf exists between the artists and the technicians
> who need to bring those designs to life. Co-presented by a graphic designer
> and a developer, we’ll discuss our approach to keeping both artists and
> technicians within their comfort zone to create applications that work well
> AND look good.

Pub
---

When the talks end we head over to a local pub to grab some food, a drink, and discuss the talks we've just seen and other goings-on in the Ruby community.  The pub is:

> Singer Tavern<br/>1 City Road<br/>EC1Y 1AG<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)

We should be there just after 8pm.  If you're unable to attend the talks, do feel free to come along just for the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7413-lrug-november-2015-meeting).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7413-lrug-november-2015-meeting).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-november/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

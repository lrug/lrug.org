The January 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of January*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#jan15registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Who’s afraid of database views?

[Robbie Clutton](https://twitter.com/robb1e) isn't, that's for sure:

> Many Rails codebases I look at work hard to put all logic into
> the application source code, using the database only a dumb
> store. But, there are circumstances where it makes sense to
> leverage features of a database and in this talk I'll cover one
> of those features in Views. I'll walk through examples of why you
> might want logic in two places, how views compare to caching
> for performance considerations, using views as a facade on
> legacy tables and how to test views alongside your application.

### PeerConnect all the things

[Tom Cartwright](http://www.tomcartwright.net/) says:

> [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/) is an exciting technology currently in, or coming
> soon to a browser near you. In this talk I will explain what
> it is, how it works and how to setup some ruby services to
> support a WebRTC-based application.

### Telling stories through your commits

[Joel Chippindale](https://twitter.com/joelchippindale) has a story to tell:

> In this talk we'll look at some of the ways that you can
> improve how you develop code and communicate with your team
> through your commits.

## Pub

After the speakers are done it's time for the rest of us to give our vocal chords a workout.  We have to leave Skills Matter by 8pm so we head to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to do so.  If you can't make the talks then do feel free to attend this part.  There's no need to register for this bit though, so just turn up!

## Registration {#jan15registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6937-lrug-january-2015-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6937-lrug-january-2015-meetup).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

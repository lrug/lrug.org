The September 2015 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of September*, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (talks start at 6:30pm).

### Venue change!

We're back with our usual hosts, [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com), but it's in their new [Code Node venue](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations.  [Full venue and registration details are given below](#sep15registration).

## Agenda

### A pull request slackbot : the seal

[Tatiana Soukiassian](https://twitter.com/binaryberry) says:

> As part of my 20% project at GDS, I developed a Slackbot that reminds
> developers of their team's pull requests that are awaiting review. I
> will talk about why and how [the seal](https://github.com/binaryberry/seal/)
> was built, and what I learned from building it.

### Containers Patterns for Rails

[Jairo Diaz](https://twitter.com/codescrum) says:

> In this talk we explore how to use docker containers to run ruby on
> rails applications.  Rails applications usually require several
> different components such as Nginx, Redis, MySQL, Mongo and background
> jobs. We will show how to set up and manage the configuration of these
> elements.

### Learning through blameless reviews

[Joel Chippindale](https://twitter.com/joelchippindale) says:

> In this talk I will outline some of the ways that teams react to the
> mistakes they make and how blameless reviews can help teams learn from
> these mistakes

### Ticket Giveaway #2

{::sponsor name="Braintree Payments" size="main" /}

The nice folk at [Braintree Payments](http://braintreepayments.com/) got in touch to provide us with two 1-day passes for [FOWA London 2015](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://futureofwebapps.com/london-2015/&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFk7OQF0n8x7h7KsPZ4NqZEvJtDXw), a web and frontend conference in London on 5-7th October.

## Pub

After the talks we continue the meeting at a nearby pub.  We're still trying out the local pubs to see which one will suit us the best.  This time we're going to try out Singer Tavern:

> Singer Tavern<br/>1 City Road<br/>EC1Y 1AG<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)

Our talks should end at about 8pm, so if you are unable to attend those you can still join us afterwards in the pub.

Not content with providing the tickets for FOWA, the extremely nice folk at [Braintree Payments](http://braintreepayments.com/) have also arranged to put some money behind the bar after the meeting.  Thanks again [Braintree Payments](http://braintreepayments.com/)!

## Venue & Registration {#sep15registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

### Venue

The venue for this meeting is:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7284).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7284).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-september/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

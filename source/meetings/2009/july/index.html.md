The next meeting of LRUG will be on Wednesday the 8th of July, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  As usual our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will provide the space, this time at a new venue [The Crypt](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/home/166/26) (it's very close to the other venues).  We still need people to <a href="#jul09registration">register</a> though to make sure the room is set up properly.

Agenda
------

### Do Mix Your Drinks

[Tom Stuart](http://experthuman.com/) will be talking about how abstract algebra is useful for Ruby programmers, both when writing everyday programs and when going to the pub afterwards. As an example he'll show how to use his [VectorSpace](http://github.com/tomstuart/vector_space) library to compare and manipulate structured data for free.

A video of Tom's talk is available on the [Skills Matter site](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/do-mix-your-drinks).

### Ruby+Arduino

[Tomasz Wegrzanowski](http://t-a-w.blogspot.com/) will be giving a talk that he describes as follows:

> [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) is an inexpensive Open Source physical computing
> platform which makes building interactive gadgets of your design
> much easier on the hardware side. Now let's add some Ruby
> so programming those gadgets becomes easy too...

A video of Tomasz's talk is available on the [Skills Matter site](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/rubyarduino).

Pub
---

After the meeting it's usual to continue the meeting in a more informal style at [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html).  This pub is just down the street from our new venue, in fact you'd have to walk past it on the way to the tube station, so it's hard to avoid.  Speaking of avoiding things, if you can't make the main meeting, we aim to be in the pub from about 8pm and you're more than welcome to come along and help us prop up the bar.

Registration <a name="jul09registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

We need people to [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-july) if they are planning on attending.  Registration lets Skills Matter know how many people to expect to turn up and plan the venue accordingly.  We shouldn't have capacity problems with the new venue, but you should still [register as early as you can](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-july) to help them out.

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2884083/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of MArch, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  As usual our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will provide the space, either at [their offices](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=EC1R+0BE&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1&iwloc=addr) or [their overflow venue](http://tinyurl.com/5qfpkc), depending on the number of <a href="#mar09registration">registrations</a>.  On very busy nights we've had to turn people away, so make sure that you do <a href="#mar09registration">register your attendance early</a> to avoid this. 

## Agenda

### Redcar: Ruby, Gnome and Textmate

[Daniel Lucraft](http://daniellucraft.com/) has been building [Redcar](http://www.redcaride.com/) for some time now and wants to talk about it:

> Redcar is a programmer's text editor for Gnome, written in Ruby. In this talk I'll
> show off Redcar's features, and then take a look into how it's implemented. We'll also
> look at the [Ruby-GNOME2](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/) bindings, and how to interface [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) (a C# like language) with Ruby
> for performance.

### Cucumber, Celerity, & FireWatir

[Aidy Lewis](http://agiletester.blogspot.com/) is going to give a talk about testing:

> The talk will explain Story-Driven-Development(SDD) and its benefits. A sample application will be
> built in real-time using SDD with [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) [Cucumber](http://cukes.info). Tests 
> will be run in-browser with [FireWatir](http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FireWatir) and through 
> a headless-browser using [Celerity](http://celerity.rubyforge.org/) and [JRuby](http://jruby.codehaus.org/).

## Pub

It's tradition that after the talks we descend on [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html), and make it difficult for anyone to get served at the bar for about 20 minutes.  This pub is very close to Skills Matter, and only a short stumble across Clerkenwell "Green" from the overflow venue if we're using it, and therefore is perfect for our post-meeting activities.  The meeting normally wraps up at about 8:00pm, so if you can't make it to that but still want to talk ruby, you'll find plenty of rubyists in this pub. Come along!

## Registration {#mar09registration}

[Please register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-march) if you are planning to come.  As we mentioned above, they need us to register for fire-regulations and making sure we get the best sized room for the number of attendees.  

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1841764/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

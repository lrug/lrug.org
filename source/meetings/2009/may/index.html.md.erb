The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 18th of May, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  As usual our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will provide the space at [their offices](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/home/375/1).  The room is currently at capacity, but if you <a href="#may09registration">register with them</a> they'll put you on a waiting list.

## Agenda

### Ruby FFI

[Sean O'Halpin](http://seanohalpin.github.com/) will be talking about [Ruby FFI](http://kenai.com/projects/ruby-ffi), probably using his [FFI-ncurses](http://github.com/seanohalpin/ffi-ncurses/) gem to provide some examples.

### Treetop

[Roland Swingler](http://knaveofdiamonds.tumblr.com/) has been looking at [Treetop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/):

> Regular expressions are great but they're unreadable when complex, and
> there are some things they just can't do. The alternative is to build
> a language parser - but that's really hard, isn't it? In this talk,
> I'll try and dispell that idea and show how building little languages
> in ruby is really simple. I'll show two examples: defining a
> mini-language from scratch to build XMPP bots, and using it as part of
> your screen-scraping toolbox.

### Scheme

[James Coglan](http://blog.jcoglan.com/) is writing a [Scheme interpreter in Ruby](http://github.com/jcoglan/stickup):

> [Scheme](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/) is a member 
> of the [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language) 
> family of languages, and is an excellent place to start if you're 
> interested in writing your own language. It's small and simple to parse, 
> yet has several advanced features that are only now becoming mainstream. 
> Based on [Heist](http://github.com/jcoglan/heist/), my main interpreter
> project, I present a brief overview of Scheme and use
> [Treetop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/) to create a small runtime that 
> includes booleans, integer arithmetic, variables, user-defined functions,
> conditionals, recursion and lexical closures.

## Pub

It's tradition at LRUG to head to the local pub after the talks to relax and chat with other rubyists.  We go to [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html) which is a short walk from either of the venues Skills Matter provides.  If you can't make the main meeting you'll find plenty of rubyists propping up the bar from about 8:00pm onwards after the talks.  Come along!

## Registration {#may09registration}

[Please register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-may) if you are planning to come (or even just thinking about it).  Please register as early as you can.  In fact, [go and do it now](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-may)!  The reason for this is that if a lot of folk want to come we obviously need a larger room and Skills Matter need about a week's notice to book it.  They'll only do so if the registrations dictate it.  If you register late they might not have enough time to book a larger room and you might get put on a waiting list or simply turned away.  We don't want that!

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2128116/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

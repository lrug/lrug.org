The next meeting of LRUG will be on Wednesday the 9th of December, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will provide the space, at our new venue [The Crypt](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/home/166/26) (it's very close to our previous venues).  Despite the new venue it's still important for people to <a href="#dec09registration">register</a> so Skills Matter know how many people to expect and set the room up correctly.

## Agenda

### DDD (Domain Driven Design)

[Alex Young](http://blog.blackkettle.org/) is going to talk about DDD.  Chances are his talk will be based on [a comment he made on the mailing list](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2009-November/004312.html):

> I *also* think that of the major Ruby ORM libraries, only Sequel is really
> aligned with DDD in the first place, so if you're using anything else you've
> already compromised the model (although again, possibly that's a discussion
> for another time).

A video of Alex's talk can be found on the [Skills Matter site](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/domain-driven-design-1187).

### Javascript Stories: The Animal, Mineral or Vegetable guide to testing javascript in web applications.

[Rob Holland](http://blog.the-it-refinery.co.uk) describes his talk as follows:

> The talk will cover how to use [capybara](http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) with
> [cucumber](http://cukes.info/) to easily write and run stories including javascript
> functionality. The talk should be useful to people who don't currently test their
> javascript, or those who are already doing so with another framework.

A video of Rob's talk can be found on the [Skills Matter site](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/javascript-stories).

### Analogue Blog

At the start of each meeting we have 10-15 minutes set aside for anyone in the room to speak.  It's run "open" style, so you don't need to ask for permission, just stand up and say something.  In the past we've had new site announcements, gem demos, new framework announcements, overviews of recent conferences; basically anything you might post a link to on something like [Ruby Flow](http://rubyflow.com), you should think about mentioning here.

## Pub

We aim to finish up the meeting by 8pm, after which we mosey on down to [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html) to continue the evening.  If for any reason you can't make the talks feel free to come along to the pub and mix with your fellow rubyists.  In fact, if you get there early, you can get the first drinks in!

## Registration {#dec09registration}

[Registration](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-dec) isn't mandatory as there's always room in the venue on the night, however, registration lets Skills Matter arrange the room properly so if you don't register you might have to sit on the floor.  So, please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-dec).

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4880415/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

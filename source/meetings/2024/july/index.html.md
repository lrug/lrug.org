The July 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 8th of July, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the lovely folk at
[Cleo](https://meetcleo.com) in [their offices][cleo-venue], on
Shoreditch High St. [Full venue and registration details are given
below](#july24registration).

## Agenda

### That smells like time

[fell sunderland](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fell-sunderland) says:

> How does an experienced programmer solve problems? It's simpler (and more
> complicated) than you might think!

## From Spaghetti to Lasagna: Layering your code with DDD

[Lily Stoney](https://github.com/LilyStoney)

> How to apply DDD to a monolithic codebase, the benefits and reasons why it can
> be beneficial, and how the event storming process can make the process of
> defining domain boundaries a simpler task!

## Afterwards

After the talks are finished, and we've tidied up the venue a bit, we head over
to a local pub for some food and drinks and the opportunity to chat with each
other.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#july24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[july2024-ticket-tailor]**.

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Cleo<br/>Unit 2.10, 2nd Floor<br/>Tea Building<br/>56 Shoreditch High St.<br/>London<br/>E1 6JJ<br/><br/>[See on a map][cleo-venue]

The venue has a hard limit of 60 people.  If you register and realise you
can't come, please use eventbrite to give up your place so we can someone
else come in your place.  We might be able to let in people on the night
who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

#### Accessibility info for the venue

Below you can find all the accessibility info for Cleo's office:

- There is step free access to enter the Tea Building from both entrances (Redchurch St and Bethnal Green Rd)
- There are stairs and a small open platform lift to get you from the Tea Building lobby to the lifts going up to the 2nd floor
- There are 2 lifts for transporting people to each floor of the Tea Building
- There is step-free access from the lifts to Cleo's office unit
- The double doors to the office may be opened to accommodate a wider wheelchair or motorised chair
- The main floor of our office is step free
- There is 1 accessible restroom in the office, and 6 restrooms in total

Now, there are a couple of caveats, which we hope will not deter anybody:

- The main doors into the Tea Building do not auto-open - they open inwards with a push
- The door to Cleo's office does not auto-open - it opens inwards with a push.

The September 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of September, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the lovely folk at
[Bloom & Wild](https://www.bloomandwild.com/careers) in [their offices][bloom-and-wild-venue], near Vauxhall. They've also kindly agreed to provide pizza and drinks. [Full venue and registration details are given
below](#september24registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

After the talks are finished, and we've tidied up the venue a bit, we head over
to a local pub for some food and drinks and the opportunity to chat with each
other.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#september24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[september2024-ticket-tailor]**.

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Bloom and Wild<br/>Unit 301 Vox Studios<br/>1-45 Durham Street<br/>London<br/>SE11 5JH<br/><br/>[See on a map][bloom-and-wild-venue]

Bloom and Wild are based in the West Tower as you enter the courtyard - [directions here](https://citymapper.com/go/o62yey67xs).

There will likely be someone situated in the courtyard to direct people to the office and let them in but if not instructions on entering the building below:

- When you arrive at the West Building (the one without the concierge / cafe), please call 301 on the keypad and someone will let you in.
- Make your way to the lift (located up some small steps) and press 301 again in the keypad to the left of the lift doors.
- Once in the lift, press level 3 and this will bring you to reception


The venue has a hard limit of 50 people.  If you register and realise you
can't come, please use tickettailor to give up your place so we can someone
else come in your place.  We might be able to let in people on the night
who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

Below you can find all the accessibility info for Bloom & Wild's office:

> For step-free access there are two lifts in the West Tower, one beside the stairs as you enter the building and the other to access the 3rd floor.

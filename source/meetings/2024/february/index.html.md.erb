## Agenda

Our February meeting is our annual event devoted to short talks of no more

### Data pagination for jekyll-paginate-v2

[Jay Caines-Gooby](https://jay.gooby.org):

> A quick dive into getting data-pagination (.csv, .json, .tsv
> & .yaml files in your _data directory) working with the [jekyll-paginate-v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2)
> gem. After deciding that I wanted to archive my posts to a Slack
> #music-we-like channel, I wanted to also make the archived posts
> paginatible...

### Using devcontainers with Ruby

[Jonathan James](https://github.com/jonathanjames1729):

> When an engineer joins your organisation, how long does it take for
> them to configure their development environment? I will discuss using
> [devcontainers with VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to reduce this time from "days" to
> "minutes''.

### Contract testing between Ruby applications

[Katya Essina](https://github.com/KatyaEssina95) & [Sarah O'Grady](https://github.com/sarah-ogrady):

> - what is contract testing & how it works
> - why we need contract testing at Funding Circle
> - what a contract test looks like for a Ruby application
> - how contract testing works in practice

### What is ruby really capable of?

[fell sunderland](https://twitter.com/felltir):

> I'd like to do a whistlestop tour of a few different gems I've written over
> the years, with the aim of talking about having fun whilst learning what
> ruby is capable of. I'd like to showcase things like [aspectual](https://github.com/AgentAntelope/aspectual)
> for bringing aspect oriented programming to ruby, [cherry-pick](https://github.com/AgentAntelope/cherry_pick)
> for when you miss `import foo from bar`, [overload](https://github.com/AgentAntelope/overload) for when you
> want to *really* have optional arguments do something different, and more!

### Phlex for a happy developer!

[Martin Tomov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-tomov/):

> More than 100 lines files are bad? Not if you have the right tools! Inline
> your templates, JavaScript, business & controller logic for maximum
> productivity!

### Be More GARY: How to up your RSpec Game

[Scott Matthewman](https://twitter.com/scottm):

> Elevate your RSpec tests by questioning common DRY practices. Enter the GARY
> method, where strategic repetition enhances test clarity and maintainability.
> Resist premature refactoring and convoluted logic, leaving yourself with
> clearer tests that document your code. Go ahead, repeat yourself.

### Making games with ruby

[Paolo Fabbri](https://internetblacksmith.dev):

> everyone, from beginners to pros. Explore its key features, and jumpstart
> your journey into the world of game creation.
> Join us to transform your ideas into reality with ease!

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

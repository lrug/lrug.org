The February 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 12th of
February, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Funding
Circle](https://fundingcircle.com) in [their offices][fc-venue], on Queen
Victoria St. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#feb24registration).

## Agenda

Our February meeting is our annual event devoted to short talks of no more
than 10 minutes.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#feb24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

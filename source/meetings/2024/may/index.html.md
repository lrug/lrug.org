The May 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of May, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the
lovely folk at [Cleo](https://meetcleo.com) in [their
offices][cleo-venue], on Shoreditch High St. [Full venue and registration
details are given below](#may24registration).

## Agenda

### Build and maintain large Ruby applications

[Enrico Teotti](https://teotti.com) says:

> This presentation will be about the challenges of building large Ruby web applications and how to maintain existing ones. I will use examples adapted from real applications that I worked on during my 10 years of experience with Ruby outlining: technical limitations of the language, how to use a modular dependency structure to enforce boundaries in complex domains.

### Building modern eCommerce applications using Rails 7

[Winston Ferguson](https://winstonferguson.com) says:

> With the newest Rails version, we can create platforms that offer the
> modern features customers and sellers expect, with less complexity. Combine
> it with an established open-source gem like Spree, and you've got a
> comprehensive commerce system. I'll share my learnings from three real-life
> examples: a music label selling limited edition vinyl LPs, a wholesaler
> shedding enterprise SaaS for a tailor-made setup, and my furniture startup,
> where CAD brings bespoke pieces to life.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#may24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

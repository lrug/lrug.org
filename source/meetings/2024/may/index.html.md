The May 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of May, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the
lovely folk at [Cleo](https://meetcleo.com) in [their
offices][cleo-venue], on Shoreditch High St. [Full venue and registration
details are given below](#may24registration).

## Agenda

### Build and maintain large Ruby applications

[Enrico Teotti](https://teotti.com) says:

> This presentation will be about the challenges of building large Ruby web applications and how to maintain existing ones. I will use examples adapted from real applications that I worked on during my 10 years of experience with Ruby outlining: technical limitations of the language, how to use a modular dependency structure to enforce boundaries in complex domains.

### Building modern eCommerce applications using Rails 7

[Winston Ferguson](https://winstonferguson.com) says:

> With the newest Rails version, we can create platforms that offer the
> modern features customers and sellers expect, with less complexity. Combine
> it with an established open-source gem like Spree, and you've got a
> comprehensive commerce system. I'll share my learnings from three real-life
> examples: a music label selling limited edition vinyl LPs, a wholesaler
> shedding enterprise SaaS for a tailor-made setup, and my furniture startup,
> where CAD brings bespoke pieces to life.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#may24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[may2024-ticket-tailor]**.

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Cleo<br/>Unit 2.10, 2nd Floor<br/>Tea Building<br/>56 Shoreditch High St.<br/>London<br/>E1 6JJ<br/><br/>[See on a map][cleo-venue]

The venue has a hard limit of 60 people.  If you register and realise you
can't come, please use eventbrite to give up your place so we can someone
else come in your place.  We might be able to let in people on the night
who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

#### Accessibility info for the venue

Below you can find all the accessibility info for Cleo's office:

- There is step free access to enter the Tea Building from both entrances (Redchurch St and Bethnal Green Rd)
- There are stairs and a small open platform lift to get you from the Tea Building lobby to the lifts going up to the 2nd floor
- There are 2 lifts for transporting people to each floor of the Tea Building
- There is step-free access from the lifts to Cleo's office unit
- The double doors to the office may be opened to accommodate a wider wheelchair or motorised chair
- The main floor of our office is step free
- There is 1 accessible restroom in the office, and 6 restrooms in total

Now, there are a couple of caveats, which we hope will not deter anybody:

- The main doors into the Tea Building do not auto-open - they open inwards with a push
- The door to Cleo's office does not auto-open - it opens inwards with a push.

The June 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 10th of June, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the lovely folk at [Le
Wagon](https://business.lewagon.com) in [their offices][le-wagon-venue] on
Kingsland Road (near Hoxton overground). [Full venue and registration details
are given below](#june24registration).

## Agenda

### Things I've learned maintaining OpenStreetMap

[Andy Allan](https://www.gravitystorm.co.uk/) says:

> Maintaining one of the world's largest non-commercial websites,
> [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org), is a unique challenge. We're a
> small, volunteer-based development team, not professional software
> developers. I will illustrate some of these challenges with a mixture of
> technical and organisational tips, tricks and recommendations, that you might
> find useful for your own teams and projects too.

### LiveView: stateful, server-rendered HTML

[Yevhenii Kurtov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtov/) says:

> LiveView is  Elixir's analogue to Hotwire that also helps to keep it closer
> to the server and contributes to the One Person Framework movement.  In this talk,
> we will explore how the stateful model makes it different from similar technologies
> and what optimisations the Phoenix team did to make it feel snappy and deliver a world-class UX

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#june24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all

be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

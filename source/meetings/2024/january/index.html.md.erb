The January 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 8th of
January, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the
lovely folk at [Cleo](https://meetcleo.com) in [their
offices][cleo-venue], on Shoreditch High St. [Full venue and registration
details are given below](#jan24registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#jan24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

## Agenda

### Saving My Relationship with Rails

Adam Dawkins says:

> Setting healthy boundaries for a happy app. Our apps inevitably get more
> complex over time, and Rails isn't always helpful when that happens. In this
> talk we'll explore what a Rails app can look like with a 'functional core',
> and where to draw the boundaries between the core and Rails to stop things
> getting out of control.

### Mistakes Were Made: Lessons from Failure

[Clem Capel-Bird](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemcapelbird/) says:

> This is a story of failure: the things I broke delivering a big project, the
> lessons those mistakes taught me, and why breaking things can be an
> engineerâ€™s best tool for learning.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll move to a nearby pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

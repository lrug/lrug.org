to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

[Full venue and registration details are given below](#mar24registration).

## Agenda

### How to Stop Being a Subject Matter Expert

[Luke Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/luke-thomas/19/5b6/22a) says:

> Tactics for helping that stressed-out single point of failure in your life
> become a happier member of a team...of multiple points of failure.

### WTF is Technical Strategy

[Laurie Young](https://laurieyoung.co.uk/) says:

> The phrase "Technical Strategy" is often used by senior leaders when they want
> something from their tech teams. However, it's an unclear phrase that doesn't
> explain what is needed or why. In this talk, you will learn what's behind the
> phrase, but also how anyone from a CTO to a new developer can use that
> knowledge to drive conversations that will help not just the leadership but
> the whole organisation.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#mar24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[march2024-ticket-tailor]**.

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Canva<br/>33 Hoxton Square<br/>London<br/>N1 6PB<br/><br/>[See on a map]
[canva-venue]

The venue has a hard limit of 150 people.  Even with such a high number, if you
register and realise you can't come, please use ticket tailor to give up your
place so someone else can come in your place.  We might be able to let in people
on the night who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

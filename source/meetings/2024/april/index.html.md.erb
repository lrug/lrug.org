The April 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 8th of April, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
in [their offices][canva-venue], on Hoxton Square.
[Full venue and registration details are given below](#apr24registration).

## Agenda

### Do you want a flake with that?

[Murray Steele](http://h-lame.com):

> Flaky tests are awful, in this talk we'll explore why tests flake and look at
> some techniques and tools you can use to discover why your tests are flaking.

### What the Chernobyl disaster can teach us about incident response

[Frederick Cheung](https://ruby.social/@fglc2) says:

> What does the worst nuclear disaster ever have in common with a web application being down?
> On the face of it, vanishingly little, but the incredible series of events before, during and
> after the disaster have plenty of insights to teach us about more mundane situations

### Talks needed!

[You](mailto:talks@lrug.org), maybe?

> We still have room for more talks, [get in touch](mailto:talks@lrug.org) to volunteer!

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#apr24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[april2024-ticket-tailor]**.

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Canva<br/>33 Hoxton Square<br/>London<br/>N1 6PB<br/><br/>[See on a map]
[canva-venue]

The venue has a hard limit of 150 people.  Even with such a high number, if you
register and realise you can't come, please use ticket tailor to give up your
ticket so someone else can come in your place.  We might be able to let in
people on the night who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

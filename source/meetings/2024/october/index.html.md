The October 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 14th of
October, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/)
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#oct24registration).

## Agenda

### Fighting Enshittification with ActivityPub

[James Smith](https://mastodon.me.uk/@Floppy) says:

> ActivityPub is the protocol that powers the Fediverse, a web of social sites
> like Mastodon, PixelFed, and a host of other free and open source tools. I’ll
> explain what ActivityPub is, how it works, and discuss the Federails Rails
> engine which allows you to add federation into your existing Rails web apps.
> By breaking open the silos of existing social media like this, we can fight
> the enshittification of the web and reclaim a bit of power from the massive
> companies that own our online lives.

### Plan to scale or plan to fail: an evidence-based approach for improving systems performance

[Jade Dickinson](https://jadedickinson.com) is giving us a preview of her RubyConf 2024 talk:

> In this talk, I will present a methodology for replicating most standard
> Rails systems, for the purpose of load testing.
>
> You can use this to find out how your system performs with more traffic than
> you currently encounter. This will be useful if you are on a Rails team that
> is starting to see scaling challenges.
>
> At Theta Lake we operate at scale and are applying this methodology to
> proactively find ways to bring down our server costs. You don’t want to leave
> it until either your server costs soar out of control, or your entire system
> is about to fail. By seeing into the future just a little bit, you can find
> bottlenecks in your system and so find where you can improve its scalability.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#oct24registration}

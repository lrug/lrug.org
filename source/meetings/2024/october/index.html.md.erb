The October 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 14th of
October, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/)
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#oct24registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#oct24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[october2024-ticket-tailor]**.

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Zappi<br/>Theatre House<br/>97 - 99 Camden High St<br/>London<br/>NW1 7JN<br/><br/>[See on a map][zappi-venue]

The venue has a hard limit of 100 people.  If you register and realise you
can't come, please use eventbrite to give up your place so we can someone
else come in your place.  We might be able to let in people on the night
who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

The August 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 12th of August, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the lovely folk at
[the Electric Car Scheme](https://www.electriccarscheme.com/careers) in [their offices][ecs-venue], near Harlington & Hayes Elizabeth line station. They've also graciously agreed to provide pizza and beverages. [Full venue and registration details are given
below](#august24registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

After the talks are finished, and we've tidied up the venue a bit, we head over
to a local pub for some food and drinks and the opportunity to chat with each
other.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

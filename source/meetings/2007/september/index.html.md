The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 10th of September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm at our usual [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) venue at [1 Sekforde St.](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=EC1R+0BE&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1&iwloc=addr).

## Agenda

### StaticMatic

[Stephen Bartholomew](http://www.stephenbartholomew.co.uk/) was going to give a talk [last month](http://lrug.org/meetings/2007/07/23/august-2007-meeting/) but kindly stepped aside to let [Jay Phillips](http://jicksta.com/), who was only in the country for a few weeks, do a talk.  This month however, there'll be no such chivalry and Stephen is determined to talk to us about his gem [StaticMatic](http://rubyforge.org/projects/staticmatic/) and the technologies that it uses.

StaticMatic is a gem for building static websites and it uses the [love it](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/05/haml-beauty-of-efficiency) or [hate it](http://meta.ath0.com/2007/04/15/software-and-religion/) alternate templating language [Haml & Sass](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/).  The gem is perfect for... well, as Stephen says:

> CMS is overrated. A lot of the time, clients want us to do what we do
> best - well designed pages with structured, accessible and maintainable
> markup & styling.
>
> CMSs are often sufficient for this, but sometimes they can be restrictive
> and more cumbersome than just working with good ol' source code. At the
> same time we want our code to be structured, DRY and flexible.

### Hpricot, Merb, Net::TOC

[Tom Armitage](http://infovore.org) hates crappy websites, more so when he actually wants access to the content they provide.  In an effort to save his sanity he's been playing about with some ruby libraries, and he's going to tell us all about it in a talk he's titled "Turning the web on its head: Screen-scraping with Hpricot, DIY-API, and conversational interfaces".  He's going to cover:

* a quick introduction to [Hpricot](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/)
* a quicker introduction to [Merb](http://merb.rubyforge.org/)
* a look at the [Net::TOC](http://http://rubyforge.org/projects/net-toc/) library

## Pub

After all this we move on from the Skills Matter office to [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html) just round the corner.  Here we sup from the selection of fine beers and wines on offer and continue the discussions.  If you can't make it to the presentations then feel free to come along just for this bit.

## Registration {#sep07registration}

As usual, [please register with Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/lrug) if you are planning to come, so they can manage seating and making sure we get the most appropriately sized room.  There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/257272) for those of us that love online calendaring.

The January 20007 meeting is going to depart from the normal presentation format and we're going to have a pub quiz instead.  We'll do the usual 'what's been going on in the London Ruby community round-up' before quizzing. So if anyone managed to pull themselves away from crying into their turkey over ['The Snowman'](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084701/) and get some exciting new projects off the ground then this'll be the time to let us know!

Date and time will be as usual; 2nd Monday of the month (8th of January, 2007), with kick-off at around 6:30pm for the London Ruby community round-up, with the quiz starting at about 7:00. The location is [The Old Crown](http://www.old-crown.co.uk/) on [New Oxford Street](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=33+New+Oxford+Street,+London,+London+WC1A+1BH).

We'll be in the 2nd floor function room at The Old Crown. There will be a bar menu available all night, providing tapas style snacks.

The quiz format will be as follows:

* Round 1: London
* Round 2: Ruby (community and history)
* Round 3: Users (famous folk)
* Round 4: Group (music)
* Round 5: a picture round

Each round will have 10 questions, but there'll be bonus points available as and when I see fit.

Teams should be of 4 or less (we may change this on the night depending on numbers), and there'll be a prize for best team name.

The prizes are a selection of Ruby books kindly donated by O'Reilly and Addison-Wesley, plus other bits and bobs donated by LRUG members.

I've created an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.org/event/132196/), so you can register interest and keep an eye on the details, in case they change.  Alternatively join our [mailing list](/mailing-list) where we'll no doubt be discussing it.

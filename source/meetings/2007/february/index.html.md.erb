Our next meeting will be on the 12th of February from 6:30pm to 8:00pm and see us return to our usual [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) venue at [1 Sekforde St](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=EC1R+0BE&ie=UTF8&z=16&ll=51.523938,-0.104799&spn=0.008571,0.018969&om=1&iwloc=addr).

## Agenda

### Saving The World With Rails

We've got [Richard Livsey](http://livsey.org/) lined up to tell us how he's been _Saving The World With Rails_

> Richard will discuss his experience with Ruby and Rails and what he has found whilst developing a suite of
> applications to prepare for and respond to disasters. Specifically, he will look at how Ruby helped him and
> CitySafe rapidly prototype an application to model liquid gas spills, some of the plug-ins they have developed.
> He will also touch upon building RESTful applications in Rails.

### TabNav

_Unfortunately Paolo was unable to make it for this meeting due to illness, however, he did make it for the [April meeting instead](/meetings/2007/04/04/april-2007-meeting/)._

As a warm up to Richard's talk we've got [Paolo Don&agrave;](http://paolodona.blogspot.com/), over from Padova in Italy, asking us _Do we really need a plugin for tabbed navigation?_

> Paolo will show us the [tabnav plugin](http://blog.seesaw.it/pages/tabnav), and discuss its implementation. This plugin raises a few questions on
> how we deal with view components. Is it ok to have configurable and ready-to-use widgets instead of rails
> helpers? How should those widgets be configured? Is it ok to write a specific DSL for each widget? This
> presentation raises many questions, and Paolo will give us his point of view and try to stimulate a
> discussion around it.

## Pub

Of course as usual we'll decamp to [the pub round the corner](http://www.fancyapint.com/main_site/thepubs/pub199.html) afterwards for a beer or two.

## Registration {#feb07registration}

If you're coming, make sure to register with Skills Matter on their [registration page](http://skillsmatter.com/lrug) so they have a handle on numbers.  For calendaring fans there's an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.org/event/144326/) too.  You'll still need to register with Skills Matter even if you say you are attending on upcoming, because there's nothing more fun than telling the internet something twice.

Our next will be on March 12th, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm at our usual [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) venue at [1 Sekforde St.](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=EC1R+0BE&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1&iwloc=addr)

## Agenda

As part of Monday's meeting [Tom Ward](mailto:tom@popdog.net) is going to help lead a code review. We'll look at some sections of ruby, and open the floor for comments, questions and constructive criticism.  Hopefully it will get everyone thinking, and help share knowledge across the group.  For it to work though, what we need is code!

Here are some examples of things we're looking for:

* Ruby Newbie code.  Maybe we can help make it more idiomatic
* Ruby patterns you use every day.  Share them with the group
* Code you know smells bad, but just can't put your finger on why.  Let us help!
* Code you're sure is the best ever.  Let us tear it apart!
* Any hints/tips/shortcuts
* Anything else you think would be good to discuss

So, if you've got some code you'd like to subject to our collective wisdom, send it to [Tom Ward](mailto:tom@popdog.net) as soon as you can.  He'll try and run it like Question time, collating the submissions and pacing them so we don't just spend 60 minutes moaning about bits of rails.

Let's make the first LRUG with crowd-sourced content a success!

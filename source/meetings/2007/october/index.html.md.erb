The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 8th of October, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm at our usual [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) venue at [1 Sekforde St.](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=EC1R+0BE&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1&iwloc=addr).

## Agenda

### resouces_controller

[Ian White](http://blog.ardes.com/) has developed a rails plugin called [resources_controller](http://plugins.ardes.com/doc/resources_controller/) which he's going to show off to us.  It answers the problems that many rails developers have noticed with the new RESTful approach; RESTful controllers are mostly boiler-plate code - repeated over and over.  

More about the plugin can be found on [Ian's blog](http://blog.ardes.com/resources_controller) and the slides are available at the [same place](http://blog.ardes.com/2007/10/10/resources_controller-at-lrug).

### Netbeans - The open source Ruby IDE written in *cough*Java*cough*

[DJ Walker-Morgan](http://codepope.com/) was lined up to do a demo of Netbeans as a ruby development platform at the LRUG BoF session at the [No Fluff Just Stuff Exchange](http://www.nfjs-exchange.com/).  Unfortunately, timing constraints meant he didn't get to give it so we've invited him to run it at this month's LRUG meeting instead.

His talk will be heavily demo-based, so he can show off the features that [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org) provides to the ruby developer.  He'll be covering the latest release [6.0 Beta 1](http://www.netbeans.org/community/releases/60/index.html) which has a boat-load of new ruby/jruby/rails support.

Slides are [available here](http://homepage.mac.com/djjwm/LRUG.pdf).

## Pub

Post-talks [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html), conveniently located just round the corner from the Skills Matter offices, becomes our home for the rest of the evening.  There's usually a lot of good discussions here, so if you don't think you can make it for the presentations then just come along to the pub, you're more than welcome.

## Registration {#oct07registration}

As usual, [please register with Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/lrug) if you are planning to come.  This way they can manage seating and make sure we get the most appropriately sized room.  There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/271749/) for those of us that love online calendaring.

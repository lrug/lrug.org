The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 16th of April, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm at our usual [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) venue at [1 Sekforde St.](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=EC1R+0BE&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1&iwloc=addr).

## Agenda

A video of the meeting, filmed by Skills Matter, is [available on Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=66709923918091739).

### Tabnav

First up, [Paolo Don&agrave;](http://paolodona.blogspot.com/) will be giving his talk about the [TabNav plugin](http://blog.seesaw.it/pages/tabnav) that he missed from our [February meeting](/meetings/2007/01/24/february-2007-meeting/) due to his being ill.  You can read more about this talk on the [February meeting page](/meetings/2007/01/24/february-2007-meeting/).

### REST Discussion

Following that we'll have a REST discussion, chaired by [Jonathan Leighton](http://turnipspatch.com/), about the new RESTful features that Rails 1.2 brings us.  There were two long threads on the [LRUG mailing list](/mailing-list) that sparked this off, so you should read them for an idea of what we might cover.

* [The original thread](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2007-February/000916.html)
* [The follow up](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2007-March/000981.html)
* [A sample agenda for the discussion](http://www.asklater.com/steve/blog/?p=81)

### Misc.

If we have enough time, we may do another installment of code-review at some point in the evening.  At our [last meeting](http://lrug.org/meetings/2007/02/19/march-2007-meeting/) we didn't get round to covering all the code, and people seemed really positive about making this a regular feature.  We'll try to post the code we're going to cover onto the [mailing list](/mailing-list) before hand, so we can get straight to the reviewing without having to explain it first.

## Registration {#apr07registration}

As usual, [please register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/lrug) if you are planning to come, so they can manage seating and making sure we get the most appropriately sized room.  There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.org/event/165162/) for those of us that love online calendaring.

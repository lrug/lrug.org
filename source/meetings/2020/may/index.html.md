The May 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 11th of May*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  Like last
month the venue this time is wherever you happen to be because it's
_COMPLETELY VIRTUAL_!

We'll run the meeting on our own zoom account, so make sure you have
the zoom client for your preferred device, or know how to attend via
the web.

[Full registration details are given below](#may20registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got two talks for you in May so far.  There's room for at least one
more mid-length talk, or a couple of short ones.  We constantly need more
talks for the rest of year, so please get in touch on [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org)
if there's something you'd like to say to LRUG

### Comparing the speed and elegance of different computer languages using a Hamiltonian curve algorithm as the comparator

[Peter Bell](https://github.com/trapeze-bell-peter):

> My company (Trapeze) specialises in public transport including schedule
> optimisation. Finding Hamiltonian curves is a sub-problem to the
> travelling salesman problem and of the general problem of optimising
> pickup and drop-offs in demand responsive public transport. This talk
> will compare implementing a Hamiltonian curve finder in a number of
> different languages. The talk looks both at the speed of the language
> and the elegance. For Ruby, I compare a couple of different
> implementations. Other languages that are compared are Elixir, Go,
> Javascript, Java, C++, C# and Python.
>
> The source code is in a public Github repository details of which I will
> provide as part of my talk

### Debugging Ruby HTTP Library Surprises

[Sam Joseph](http://github.com/tansaku):

> Some folks prefer 'puts' to debugging with something like
> pry-byebug, but I'm a huge fan of debuggers, particularly stepping
> through my own code and the code of the many libraries we all rely on.
> In combination with `bundle open` to insert breakpoints into the code of
> gems being used in your stack, debugging can expose really tricky
> dependency bugs, as I aim to demonstrate with one that I found in the
> way different ruby HTTP libraries can interact.

## Afterwards

Last time there was no afterwards, we just stopped the zoom meeting.  That
felt a bit abrupt, if you've got a good idea of how to replicate the
post-talk chats get in touch at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org)
and we'll see what we can do.

## Registration {#may20registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/)
paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct)
which applies to all attendees, even though there's no pub or venue.
Basically they are good rules to generally live your life by.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the meeting
so you need to register via [eventbrite][may2020-eventbrite].  The link to
the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of
the meeting, around about 6pm.  Keep an eye out for the email and check
your spam just incase.

The September 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of September*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  In keeping with
the times, our meeting will be online.

We'll run the meeting on our own zoom account, so make sure you have
the zoom client for your preferred device, or know how to attend via
the web.

[Full registration details are given below](#sept20registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got two talks lined up for you this month. We also need more talks
for the rest of year, and beyond, so please get in touch on
[talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org) if there's something you'd like to
say to LRUG.

### StimulusJS: Modest JS for the HTML you have

[Matt Swanson](https://twitter.com/_swanson):

> An overview of [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org) (a small framework from Basecamp) and
> discussion on when you might (or might not!) want to use it

{::coverage year="2020" month="september" talk="stimulusjs-modest-js-for-the-html-you-have" /}

### Wizards without magic

[Duncan Brown](https://github.com/duncanjbrown):

> Multi-step forms (a.k.a wizards) are fiddly to build and difficult to
> test. (And not just in Rails). Why is that, and how can we make them
> better?

## Afterwards

It's not quite hanging our of drinks and food in a local pub, but a few
of us usally hang out in the Zoom chat after the meeting to chat.  It only
really works with a handful of people though, so we're still on the
lookout for something else tha would work for more attendees.  If you have
any ideas on that, do get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org) and we can explore it
together.

## Registration {#sept20registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/)
paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct)
which applies to all attendees, even though there's no pub or venue.
Basically they are good rules to generally live your life by.

so **[you need to register via eventbrite][sept2020-eventbrite]**.  The link to
the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of

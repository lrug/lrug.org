The October 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of October*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  In keeping with
the times, our meeting will be online.

We'll run the meeting on our own zoom account, so make sure you have
the zoom client for your preferred device, or know how to attend via
the web.

[Full registration details are given below](#oct20registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got two talks lined up for you this month. We also need more talks
for the rest of year, and beyond, so please get in touch on
[talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org) if there's something you'd like to
say to LRUG.

### JWTs - what Rails developers need to know

[Dan Moore](https://twitter.com/mooreds):

> What is a JSON Web Token (JWT) and why do you care? JWTs
> are a stateless, standardized way to represent user data. This talk will
> discuss why JWTs matter and the nuts and bolts of JWTs. We’ll also discuss
> how you might use a JWT in your Rails or Ruby application.

### Getting Past the Tech Test

[Michael Mazour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmazour/):

> Sometimes people have great backgrounds and great skills, but have trouble
> getting hired because they didn't approach the tech test the way the
> company wanted. As someone who reviews a lot of tech tests at work, I'm
> going to explain some of the unwritten rules and expectations that you
> might not know if you've been out of circulation or are just entering the
> job market, and help you level up your tech test game.

## Afterwards

A few of us usually hang out in the Zoom chat after the meeting. It only really
works with a handful of people though, so we're still on the lookout for
something else tha would work for more attendees. If you have any ideas on that,
do get in touch at [organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org) and we can
explore it together.

## Registration {#oct20registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees, even though there's no pub or venue. Basically they are good rules to
generally live your life by.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the meeting
so **[you need to register via eventbrite][oct2020-eventbrite]**.  The link to
the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of
the meeting, around about 6pm.  Keep an eye out for the email and check
your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

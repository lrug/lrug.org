The November 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of November*, from
_6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_). In defiance of the new
lockdown, we will be holding the meeting in Trafalgar Squ... no, of course not.
We're still online. Stay home. Protect the NHS.

[Full registration details are given below](#nov20registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

Thanks to the beautiful people who responded to our cry for talks, we've another
two lined up for you this month, but we always need more. Email
[talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), yeah? G'wan. It'd be a real help.

### Patches Welcome!

> Everybody at LRUG probably uses open source software - unless they got lost on
> the way to another meeting - but it often surprises me how few developers take
> the extra step from using it, to contributing to (or releasing their own) open
> source software projects. I'm going to talk about how I got involved in the
> open source community, why I stay involved, and about my current open source
> projects

[Denny de la Haye](https://denny.me) has been a programmer for nearly 30 years
now - "although my ZX81 code is thankfully all lost in the mists of time (AKA
audio cassettes and thermal printer paper)", he says. He has spent most of the
last 4+ years writing Ruby, and most of the 15+ before that writing Perl. The
switch between the two was less traumatic than he expected, but it did lead to
starting another open source software project last year...

### Convention over Kubernetes: (Almost) Configless Deploys with Kuby

> Rails' most well-known mantra is "convention over configuration," i.e. sane
> defaults that limit the cognitive overhead of application development. It's
> easy to learn and easy to build with. The development experience is
> fantastic... right up until the point you want to deploy your app to
>production. It's at that point that the hand-holding stops.
>
> Heroku to the rescue, right? Just push your git repo to "heroku master" and
> never think about deployment again! Heroku is a great option for many small
> projects and the ease of deployment is exactly the kind of experience Rails
> developers are used to. To quote Aaron Patterson: "but at what cost?" You're
> tied to Heroku's stack and stuck within the limitations of their free tier.
> Heroku's add-ons can get pretty expensive too if you decide to upgrade later
> on.
>
> How can we, but humble Rails devs, achieve the same seamless, turnkey
> deployment experience affordably? Enter the Kuby gem, a
> convention-over-configuration approach to deploying Rails apps using
> industry-leading technologies. Come learn how, with almost no configuration,
> you too can use Kuby to leverage Docker and Kubernetes to deploy your Rails
> app cost-effectively on a variety of cloud platforms.

[Cameron Dutro](https://twitter.com/camertron) currently works on the Quip team
at Salesforce. He's been programming in Ruby and using Rails for ten years and
has held previous positions at Fluther, Twitter, and Lumos Labs. When he's not
reading about, using, or working on technology, Cameron can be found hiking in
the hills behind his house or hanging out at home with his wife, daughter, and
cat.

## Afterwards

For the good of the country, we have had to pause our normal post-LRUG pub time,
but typically a few folks will hang on in the zoom call after the talks are
over. We've been meaning to try the new self-selecting breakout rooms too, which
we could. But inn general, the ongoing-pandemic after-meet experience could
still use some work: if you have any ideas on that, do get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

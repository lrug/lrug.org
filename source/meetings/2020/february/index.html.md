Agenda
------

### Food & Drinks

[Simply Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/) are going to make
some food and drink available to us during the meeting to help us stave
off hunger pangs while we are amazed by all the talks. Thanks again
[Simply Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/)!

### Lightning Talks

This meeting is our annual lightning talks only event.  None of the talks
are longer than 10 minutes, and so there's something for everyone.

Afterwards
----------

These lightning talks should be finished by 8pm after which we'll go to a
local pub to talk about all the things we've heard.  We'll defer to our
hosts for a suitable venue, and we'll make sure it does food for any who
may still be hungry.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

The February 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of February*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The venue this
month is provided by [Simply Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/)
and is in [their offices][simplybusiness-venue], on Gresham St near Bank
and Moorgate stations.  [Full venue and registration details are given
below](#feb20registration).

## Agenda

This meeting is our annual lightning talks only event.  None of the talks
are longer than 10 minutes, and so there's something for everyone.

### Food & Drinks

[Simply Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/) are going to make
some food and drink available to us during the meeting to help us stave
off hunger pangs while we are amazed by all the talks. Thanks again
[Simply Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/)!

### You don't know what you don't know

[Elena Tanasoiu](https://twitter.com/elenatanasoiu) says:

> How to start an investigation into transitioning from a monolith to a
> microservice architecture. A number of issues to consider before you
> start and how to make a list of blockers on the way.

### Designing Domain-Oriented Observability in your system

[Alfredo Motta](https://twitter.com/mottalrd) says:

> What does it mean to make a system observable? Too often this is translated
> into simply installing technical tools to measure low-level concerns like
> memory, CPU or background queues size. In this talk, I will present the
> concept of Domain-Oriented Observability, explore how it affects the cost
> of maintaining your system and finally show some of the tools and solutions
> that can help you put it into practice.

### Semantic Versioning, Ruby Versoning, and the forward march of progress

[Jon Rowe](https://twitter.com/JonRowe) is going to tell us about how ruby
versioning interprets semantic versioning, and the problems that brings
for maintainers of projects like rspec that support multiple versions of
ruby.

### Influence your company beyond code

[Mugurel Chirica](https://twitter.com/budmc29) says:

> It's important for all the engineers to realise that individually they are
> able to help shape a company's culture, tech excellence, and tech direction.
>
> There are various ways to achieve this, in this talk I'll present some of
> the common options while focusing on creating communities of practice -
> groups of people that meet with a common goal in mind and relevant to the
> company's interest, both sponsored by leadership or started by engineers.

> state of confusion and ending up contributing to mocha, and some things
> I learned along the way.

## Afterwards

These lightning talks should be finished by 8pm after which we'll go to a
local pub to talk about all the things we've heard.  We'll defer to our
hosts for a suitable venue, and we'll make sure it does food for any who
may still be hungry.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

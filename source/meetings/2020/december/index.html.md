The December 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of December*, from
_6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_). We're still online. Stay
home. Protect the NHS.

[Full registration details are given below](#dec20registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got one talk lined up for you this month, but we always need more. Email
[talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org), yeah? Be a pal.

### Create a Twitter clone in 15 minutes in pure Ruby with Matestack

[Jonas Jabari](https://twitter.com/jonasjabari) says:

> Matestack enables you to implement reactive web UIs in pure Ruby, skipping
> ERB, HTML and JavaScript. In a live coding session, we will create a Twitter
> clone using Matestack's core features from scratch!

## Afterwards

For the good of the country, we have had to pause our normal post-LRUG pub time,
but typically a few folks will hang on in the zoom call after the talks are
over. We've been meaning to try the new self-selecting breakout rooms too, which
we could. But in general, the ongoing-pandemic after-meet experience could
still use some work: if you have any ideas on that, do get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org).

## Registration {#dec20registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/)
paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct)
which applies to all attendees, even though we are all in our own little bubbles.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the meeting
so **[you need to register via eventbrite][dec2020-eventbrite]**.  The link to
the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of
the meeting, around about 6pm.  Keep an eye out for the email and check
your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

The August 2020 (What? Already?!) meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of August*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  Like last
month the venue this time is wherever you happen to be because it's
_COMPLETELY VIRTUAL_!

We'll run the meeting on our own zoom account, so make sure you have
the zoom client for your preferred device, or know how to attend via
the web.

[Full registration details are given below](#aug20registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got two talks this month. We also need more
talks for the rest of year, so please get in touch on [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org)
if there's something you'd like to say to LRUG

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

Normally a few of us hang around in the Zoom chat after the meeting, but we're
still on the lookout for other things we might try. If you've got a good idea of
how to replicate the post-talk chats get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org) and we'll see what we can do.

## Registration {#aug20registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/)
paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct)
which applies to all attendees, even though there's no pub or venue.
Basically they are good rules to generally live your life by.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the meeting
so **[you need to register via eventbrite][august2020-eventbrite]**.  The link to
the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of
the meeting, around about 6pm.  Keep an eye out for the email and check
your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

The January 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 13th of January*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  The venue this
month is provided by [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/about/careers/)
and is in [their offices][gocardless-venue], on Goswell Road.  [Full venue
and registration details are given below](#jan20registration).

## Agenda

This meeting is a **Ruby Talent Show** dedicated to all the things ruby can do
that isn't just pulling data out of a database and rendering it on a website.

### Food & Drinks

Not only are GoCardless letting us into their offices to run is meeting,
they're also putting on some food and drink to get us through the evening.
Thanks again [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/about/careers/)!

### You?

We’d like to hear from people using ruby for something that is a bit out
of the ordinary.  Mostly we’re probably all using ruby for building
websites, or for devops, but that’s not all ruby can do.

Some examples:

* making music
* generating graphics
* interactive chatbots
* games
* etc...

So, what are you making ruby do that fits the bill?  Or, what are you
using ruby for that doesn’t fit that bill, but also isn’t a standard
webapp?  We'd love to hear about it, whatever it is.  Show us what ruby
can do!

## Afterwards

Our goal is to be finished exploring ruby's talents by 8pm, after which
we'll move to a nearby pub to talk about the talents on show and do a spot
of socialising.  We'll take advice from GoCardless on which local pub will
best accommodate us and keep you posted if we know in advance.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

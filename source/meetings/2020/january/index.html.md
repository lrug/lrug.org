Agenda
------

### Food & Drinks

Not only are GoCardless letting us into their offices to run is meeting,
they're also putting on some food and drink to get us through the evening.
Thanks again [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/about/careers/)!

### Ruby Talent Show

This meeting is dedicated to all the things ruby can do that isn't just
pulling data out of a database and rendering it on a website.

#### Ruby on the Big Screen

[Steve Butterworth](https://twitter.com/stevewillbe) says:

> Using Ruby to crunch the numbers, read tv captions and drive a 30m long
> LED screens at The Open Golf Championships. A whistle stop tour of the
> setup, the architecture and the code that goes into making something
> like this work and what can go wrong!

#### Re-interpreting data

[Murray Steele](https://twitter.com/hlame) says:

> Some time ago I stumbled across the header description for WAV files
> and wondered, what if I took a file and calculated the appropriate WAV
> file header for it, could I _hear_ my data?  Yes, you can.  You probably
> don't want to, but you can.  You can do something similar with BMP and
> MIDI files too!

#### Ruby's a critic

[Nuno Silva](https://github.com/nunosilva800) says:

> [RubyCritic](https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic/) provides a
> report about code quality. You can run it locally to view how your
> project is doing and what are the smelly spots. A way of getting sense
> of how your code quality is evolving over time is by setting it up on
> your CI and storing the reports artefacts.

#### Getting started with mruby

[Fred Cheung](https://github.com/fglc2) says:

> find out what [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby) is, why you might
> want to use it and obstacles you might encounter along the way.

#### You?

We’d like to hear from people using ruby for something that is a bit out
of the ordinary.  Mostly we’re probably all using ruby for building
websites, or for devops, but that’s not all ruby can do.

Some examples:

* making music
* generating graphics
* interactive chatbots
* games
* etc...

So, what are you making ruby do that fits the bill?  Or, what are you
using ruby for that doesn’t fit that bill, but also isn’t a standard
webapp?  We'd love to hear about it, whatever it is.  Show us what ruby
can do!

Afterwards
----------

Our goal is to be finished exploring ruby's talents by 8pm, after which
we'll move to a nearby pub to talk about the talents on show and do a spot
of socialising.  We'll take advice from GoCardless on which local pub will
best accommodate us and keep you posted if we know in advance.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

The July 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 13th of July*,
from _6:20pm_ to _8:00pm_ (meeting starts at _6:30pm_).  Like last
month the venue this time is wherever you happen to be because it's
_COMPLETELY VIRTUAL_!

We'll run the meeting on our own zoom account, so make sure you have
the zoom client for your preferred device, or know how to attend via
the web.

[Full registration details are given below](#jul20registration), note
that **we will only be sending out the zoom meeting url to people who
have registered, so please do make sure you do it.**

## Agenda

We've got one talk linked up so far for you this month.  There's room
for more so _please_ get in touch if you'd like to talk about
something. We also need more
talks for the rest of year, so please get in touch on [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org)
if there's something you'd like to say to LRUG

### Improved security for password authentication

[Jolyon Pawlyn](https://twitter.com/jpawlyn):

> Devise is a great authentication solution and is standard in many Rails
> applications. I want to look at 2 easy improvements to the default password
> validation. Then let's see what it takes to implement bare bones two-factor
> authentication using Devise and Warden.
>
> The security features to be covered can be viewed in [an example
application](https://github.com/jpawlyn/secure-user-accounts#secure-user-accounts).

Jolyon is a volunteer at Crowdfrica, ex Contentful, Wunder Mobility and Unboxed
Consulting, and also an aspiring yardener.

### Perfect is the enemy of good

[Nicky Thompson](https://twitter.com/knotnicky):

> This talk is a rambling rag-tag collection of software engineering and
> problem-solving lessons learned over the course of *mumble* years as a
> developer and now an engineering manager. It includes practical tips,
> philosophical insights, or just advice that other people gave me that I
> found helpful. These ideas have helped me be better at my job over the
> years. They are tried and tested, things that I have actually done
> throughout my career. They might or might not help you.

Nicky is an Engineering Manager at FutureLearn, providing management and support to the Technology Team. Offline, Nicky enjoys watching bad TV and learning new stuff: this year it's a serious sewing/dressmaking habit.

### .... you?

As I mentioned above, we've basically run out of offers to give talks. I can
certainly vamp for ten minutes about whether or not I care about using single or
double quotes for strings without any interpolation, but I think it's almost
certain that some of you have some thoughts or experiences that might be more
interesting.

Please get in touch on [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org) and we will take
it from there.

### RubyConfBY Raffle

The kind folks at [RubyConfBY](https://rubyconference.by/) have given us _two_
tickets to their conference to raffle to our attendess. The conference is going
to be held (online) on the 18th & 19th of July, between 2-6PM CET (so that's
1-5PM BST). They've got a great line up of very interesting talks, and of
course, it's never been easy or cheaper to attend a conference since there's no
travel or hotel costs to factor in. But _you_ can reduce that cost to zero by
signing up to attend LRUG.

During the meeting, we'll run a raffle for all registered attendees and pick
two. And even if you don't win in the raffle, the organisers have arranged a
discount for LRUG members, which we'll share on the night.

## Afterwards

Normally a few of us hang around in the Zoom chat after the meeting, but we're
still on the lookout for other things we might try. If you've got a good idea of
how to replicate the post-talk chats get in touch at
[organisers@lrug.org](mailto:organisers@lrug.org) and we'll see what we can do.

## Registration {#jul20registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/)
paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct)
which applies to all attendees, even though there's no pub or venue.
Basically they are good rules to generally live your life by.

### Secure your place

Even in a virtual world there are limited places for attending the meeting
so **[you need to register via eventbrite][july2020-eventbrite]**.  The link to
the zoom meeting will only be sent to registered attendees on the day of
the meeting, around about 6pm.  Keep an eye out for the email and check
your spam just in case.

Do prepare yourself in advance by [downloading the zoom client](https://zoom.us/support/download).

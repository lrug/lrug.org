## Agenda

### Food & Drinks

Not only are Makers providing the venue for thie month's meeting, they're
also being kind enough to provide some food for us.  Thanks again
[Makers](https://makers.tech/)!

### I got an email from the Government the other day

[Stuart Harrison](https://twitter.com/pezholio) says:

> Email has been around for a long time, predating even the Internet, and
> despite the best efforts of big tech to monopolise our communications,
> it's still the most popular way to for people to communicate online.
> This ubiquity means it's a really easy wayf or Government to keep in
> touch with us, but email is a tricky thing to manage, running
> mailservers can be a faff, and email as a service solutions can be
> expensive. In this talk I'll go through a potted history of email, talk
> about a tool that the Government Digital Service have developed to make
> email easier for goverment agencies, and a Ruby gem I've build to make
> it even easier for Rails devs.

### My first Rails bug report

[Alex Balhatchet](https://twitter.com/kaokun) says:

> Story time! Here's the bug I found, how we determined it was a bug in
> Rails 6, how we dealt with it including working around it and submitting
> the bug report, and finally getting to remove our workaround once the
> bug was fixed and the new Rails was installed :)

### Tech for good with Ruby on Rails

[James Hand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameshand-uk/) and [Alan Bridger](https://github.com/abridger) say:

> Giki Social Enterprise uses Ruby on Rails to help people live
> sustainably. We'll talk about what we do and why Rails is such a good
> framework for helping people to make sustainable and healthy choices.

### London Ruby Events

[Jairo Diaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jairodiaz4/) says:

> I am going to tell you about the Ruby events in London that I am
> organising such as the [Ruby Hacknight](https://www.meetup.com/ruby-hacknight-london/)
> and [Ruby London Jobs](https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-Jobs-London/) and
> other events for the community that are the most common. I will also
> mention different event formats which I have experienced and found
> useful for different purposes.

## Afterwards

We should be finished these talks by 8pm.  Usually we head to a local pub
afterwards to talk about what we've just heard and get to know our fellow
attendees.  We'll see what Makers suggest for which is their preferred
watering hole and keep you posted if we know in advance.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

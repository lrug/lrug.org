## Afterwards

We should be finished these talks by 8pm.  Usually we head to a local pub
afterwards to talk about what we've just heard and get to know our fellow
attendees.  We'll see what Makers suggest for which is their preferred
watering hole and keep you posted if we know in advance.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

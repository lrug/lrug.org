The September 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of September*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#sep14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### How not to become a terrible human being once you get a leadership title.

[Mazz Mosley](http://houseofmnowster.com/) says:

> You'll never guess what happens next? Mazz will talk about some
> of the essential skills that good technical leaders exhibit and
> the information you need to know about to help you become good 
> at leading and not turn into a terrible person. Do you find 
> yourself in a position of leadership and don't know what to do 
> now? Do you think you're a great tech lead? Do you wonder if 
> you're cut out to lead one day? Great, then come and listen to
> my talk, you may find it more relevant to your interests than
> you realise.

### [Bebox](https://github.com/codescrum/bebox) - Convention over configuration for puppet repositories

[Jairo Diaz](http://www.codescrum.com/) says:

> Bebox helps automating the provisioning of environments in which
> Ruby on Rails applications run, easing the reproduction of new 
> server setups every time. 
> 
> Bebox's main concern is the structure. It is generally a good 
> idea to have conventions about how different source code files 
> are placed and named and be able to use this to reduce the 
> details required to understand a project while also providing 
> automation in key places. These conventions may include things 
> like: how to write puppet modules, how to integrate them into 
> the projects, a directory structure for the projects, how to 
> have a replicated “development/test” environment into virtual
> machines, etc.

### Learn to code in 12 weeks?

[Daniel Sun](http://danielsun.co.uk/) says:

> Having recently completed the training phase of WeGotCoders I
> will present some code from [my final project](https://github.com/dan-mi-sun/the-soul-at-work) of the 12 week 
> training course / some code recently pulled into [Diaspora*](https://www.joindiaspora.com/). 
> With more and more of us choosing this route, the aim is to 
> show those interested in the 'Immersion' model (either 
> attending a course, or hiring someone who has joined a course)
> what someone with no prior coding experience can achieve 
> within 12 weeks.

When the talks finish there's usually lots to mull over and talk about.  We have to leave Skills Matter's offices, but we don't stop the meeting; it continues at [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) which is a 5 minute walk away.  If you are unable to attend the talks, or miss out on a space, come join us for the socialising afterwards.

Registration <a name="sep14registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6530-lrug-september-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6530-lrug-september-meetup).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-september/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

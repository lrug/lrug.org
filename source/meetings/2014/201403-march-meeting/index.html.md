The March 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of March*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#mar14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### Rage against the state machine

[Andrew Appleton](https://twitter.com/appltn) says:

> A story about the problems we faced modelling state and 
> recording state changes at [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/blog/) and how we 
> generalised our solution to those problems into a new
> gem, [Statesman](https://github.com/gocardless/statesman).

### Marketing for Developers

[Derek Hill](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/derekahill/) from [eBench](http://www.eBench.com) wants to talk to us about marketing:

> I’m a relative newcomer to Ruby, but I’ve got lots of experience in
> marketing.
> 
> Over the last two years I’ve spoken to many experienced devs about
> their marketing challenges, and witnessed how simple marketing
> mistakes can derail a project.
>
> In the consumer goods industry marketing is a discipline, with 
> structured ways of working through it.   I will demonstrate that
> this structure works well for tech startups, and give you a
> practical checklist you can apply.

### Building a SOA network of daemons with Go, Ruby and ZMQ

[Ismael Celis](http://home.ismaelcelis.com/) says:

> I would like to talk about a series of custom-made infrastructure
> components that I’ve built over several months to support a hosted
> e-commerce app that I run in my spare time.
>
> This consists of a central events hub written in Go, to which the
> user-facing apps send events, and a series of Go and Ruby scripts
> subscribing to said events on a ZMQ socket and doing varied things
> such as analytics, periodical backups and house-keeping.
>
> The code I’ll show is mostly Go, with some Ruby to illustrate how
> this all hooks in to my Ruby apps and existing infrastructure. I’ll
> try to show why Go is great for writing small, focused scripts that
> support your user facing apps.

You can read a more detailed overview on [a blog post](http://new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2013/09/17/micro-network-daemons-in-go) he wrote about it a while ago.

Pub
---

Our talks usually end at 8pm, but that's not when the evening ends.  Most of the attendees head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to talk things over; the speakers are usually there too, so you can ask them about their talks if you didn't get a chance during Q&A.  The pub part of the evening open to all, so if you couldn't make the talks, or just don't fancy them, do turn up here!

Registration <a name="mar14registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6237-rage-against-the-state-machine-and-marketing-for-developers).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6237-rage-against-the-state-machine-and-marketing-for-developers).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-march/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

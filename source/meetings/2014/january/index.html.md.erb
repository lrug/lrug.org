The January 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 13th of January*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#jan14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### API Analytics with Redis and Bigquery

[Javier Ramirez](http://javier-ramirez.com/) wants to tell us about dealing with big data:

> At [teowaki](https://teowaki.com/) we have a system for API usage analytics,
> with [Redis](http://redis.io/) as a fast intermediate store and
> [bigquery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/) as a big data
> backend. As a result, we can launch aggregated queries on our
> traffic/usage data in just a few seconds and we can try and find
> for usage patterns that wouldnâ€™t be obvious otherwise.
>
> In this session I will talk about how we entered the Big Data
> world, which alternatives we evaluated, and how we are using
> Redis and Bigquery to solve our problem.

### Using data tiering to squeeze scale out of SQL

[Julien Letessier](http://dec0de.me/) also wants to talk about data:

> As traffic grows, some of the data structures our application
> has to manipulate gets contended. Ours is an unusual, but
> effective solution: segregate data into read-mostly and
> write-mostly.

## Pub

We aim to finish the talks by 8pm and continue the evening in more informal surroundings at [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  Our speakers are usually in attendance so if you have any questions for them you didn't get a chance to ask at the talks, or just want to thank them for their time this is the perfect place for it.  If you didn't make it in time for the talks, you can also come along just for this part of the evening to talk to your fellow rubyists.

## Registration {#jan14registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-january-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-january-meetup).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

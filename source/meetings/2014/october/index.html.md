The October 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 13th of October*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#oct14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### Be a good UNIX citizen

[Rob Miller](https://robm.me.uk/) says:

> The Unix command line has been the foundation of how 
> we use computers for over four decades, and has 
> changed surprisingly little in that time. I'll look at
> what it takes to elevate a throwaway one-liner or 
> personal script into a robust and re-usable CLI app, 
> and look at the Ruby techniques that make it easy to
> be a good Unix citizen.

### Live Coding in the Classroom

[Sam Aaron](http://sam.aaron.name/) and [Xavier Riley](http://xavierriley.co.uk/) want to code up some music for us:

> [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) is a Ruby-based live coding music 
> synthesiser designed to help teach both computing 
> and music within schools. It uses fast feedback,
> liveness and studio-quality sound production as a
> means to engage school children in introductory 
> coding. In this talk we will follow the story of 
> Sonic Pi from its the humble beginnings of this 
> project in a single class of school-children coding 
> beeps and bleeps to its current standing as a 
> state-of-the-art live coding system installed by 
> default on all Raspberry Pis  used to live code 
> in a variety of venues from Algoraves to national 
> music venues.  All towards a simple but deep 
> question - how can we give more people an understanding
> of what programming is and can do?

Pub
---

Our talks finish around about 8pm, but the meeting continues in the more relaxed surroundings of [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  Most attendees stick around for this bit, so it's a good chance to catch up with old friends or make some new ones as you discuss the talks and chat about the latest goings on in the ruby community.  Attendance of the formal part is not a prerequisite for attending the pub bit, so do come along!

Registration <a name="oct14registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6584-lrug-october-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6584-lrug-october-meetup).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-october/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

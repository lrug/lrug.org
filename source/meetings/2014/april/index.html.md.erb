The April 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of April*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#apr14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Adventures in early-adoption of open-source code

Some of the team from [the ODI](http://theodi.org/) want to present about their work:

> Last year, the ODI found themselves wanting to use the
> code behind [gov.uk](http://www.gov.uk) for a new project.
> In this talk [James](https://theodi.org/team/james-smith)
> and [Sam](https://theodi.org/team/sam-pikesley) from the ODI
> tech team will share their experience of picking up a codebase
> which was [open source](https://github.com/alphagov), but never
> really designed for reuse, and what they learned along the way.

### Aspect-Oriented Programming in Ruby

[Camille Baldock](http://camillebaldock.co.uk/) says:

> Many of us developers love arguing about architecture that
> we dislike and refactoring our code to loosen coupling and
> weaken dependencies between our objects. Unfortunately,
> some overarching parts of our applications, like persistence,
> networking, notifications, logging, auditing, are scattered
> in our code, forcing us to specific explicit dependencies
> between them and our domain objects.
>
> [Aspect-oriented programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming)
> is a solution to the problem of some features affecting
> virtually all business requirements, and expresses that problem
> in a compact and DRY way.
>
> In this practical talk, Camille will:
>
> * introduce the basic concepts of AOP, and how it is still relevant even in a non-statically typed language like Ruby
> * show you how to easily and quickly leverage some AOP principles in your Rails application
> * play with some AOP-friendly constructs in Ruby 2, in particular TracePoint
> * walk you through two existing Ruby frameworks to practice Aspect-Oriented Programming
>
> She will even attempt to prove that not all things coming from the Java world are necessarily bad.

## Pub

After the talks finish, usually 8pm, we decamp to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to finish up the evening.  Although you have to [register](#apr14registration) for the talks, the pub part is open to all.  If you can't make the talks feel free to turn up for this second half of the event.

### Sponsored Drinks

{::sponsor name="Resource Guru" size="main" /}

The nice folks at [Resource Guru](http://resourceguruapp.com/) are buying us some drinks at the pub after the talks.  That's nice, isn't it?


## Registration {#apr14registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6307-adventures-in-early-adoption-of-open-source-code).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6307-adventures-in-early-adoption-of-open-source-code).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-april/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

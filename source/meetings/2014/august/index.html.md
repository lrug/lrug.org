The August 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 11th of August*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#aug14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### How to make Guacamole

[Dirk Breuer](http://tfcl.de/) says:

> [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.org/) is a multi-purpose NoSQL database. There are a lot
> of features in it but without a proper high level library
> for common web frameworks no one will use a database these
> days. No matter how fancy it is. [Guacamole](http://guacamolegem.org/) is an ODM for
> ArangoDB to be used in Rack-based framework and especially
> Rails. I will talk about the design choices, caveats and my
> the general experience working on that kind of library. The
> talk will not go too deep into technical details and should
> be interesting to novice and experts alike.

### A gentle introduction to music theory (in ruby)

[Alex Speller](http://alexspeller.com/) says:

> Music theory can seem arcane and unapproachable. But underneath
> the weird names and symbols, the basics are actually pretty
> simple. The real issue is that the documentation is bad and the
> API is worse! In this talk I will show how to start with nothing
> but a ruby interpreter, and generate sine waves, notes, scales,
> modes, chords, arpeggios and songs, in a way that will be
> understandable to those who have never touched an instrument
> before and will (hopefully) offer an interesting new perspective
> even to those who are already well versed in music theory.

## Pub

The presentation-based part of the meeting ends at 8pm and we move to the social part of the meeting shortly after.  For this 2nd half we switch venues to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) so if you can't make the talks, or don't register in time, feel free to turn up just for this pub bit.

## Registration {#aug14registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6493-how-to-make-guacamole-a-gentle-introduction-to-music-theory-in-ruby).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6493-how-to-make-guacamole-a-gentle-introduction-to-music-theory-in-ruby).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-august/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

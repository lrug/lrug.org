The December 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 8th of December*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#dec14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Are you sure it's right?

[Owen Ben Davies](http://www.obduk.com/) wants us to think about what is and what isn't right with our software:

> This talk on both Rails and plain Ruby apps will cover
>
> * Testing
> * Code standards tools
> * Validations and verifications
> * Security tools and frameworks

### An RSpec 3 Talk

[Sam Phippen](http://samphippen.com/) says:

> RSpec 3 is the recently released new major version of 
> RSpec. It contains a host of new features, and has 
> removed or altered many old ones. In this talk weâ€™ll 
> cover the most significant changes that were made in 
> RSpec 3, the upgrade path between RSpec 2 and 3 and 
> some of the common pitfalls that you might fall into
> when using this new major version of RSpec.

## Pub

That all sounds super-interesting and we'll want to talk it all over together, but we have to be out of Skills Matter by 8pm.  Don't worry though, that doesn't mean the evening is over!  [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) is a short walk away and has plenty of space for us to have those discussions. No need to register for this bit, if you can't make the talks do feel free to turn up just for the socialising afterwards.

## Registration {#dec14registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6759-lrug-december-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6759-lrug-december-meetup).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-december/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

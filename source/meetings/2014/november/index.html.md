The November 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of November*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#nov14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### Julia  - Fast and Dynamic

[Avik Sengupta](http://www.sengupta.net/musings/) wants to introduce us to a new language called [Julia](http://julialang.org/):

> Can  a programming language be fast yet highly 
> dynamic? The creators of Julia, a new language with 
> a numeric focus intends to answer yes. 
>
> In this talk we will introduce the language, and 
> discuss some of its design and implementation 
> decisions that make it particularly amenable to
> generating efficient machine code. We will also talk
> about Julia's impressive language interop features, 
> and see examples of calling Ruby code from within Julia.

### Peas - A Docker and Ruby based PaaS

[Thomas Buckley-Houston](http://tombh.co.uk) says:

> I'll be looking at the basic technical concepts
> of the Platform As A Service paradigm (eg; Heroku)
> and what Docker and Ruby can contribute to it.
> Some of the highlights will be; using Docker 
> inside Docker, how to test this complex stack 
> and concurrency using the Celluloid gem.

Pub
---

After the talks are finished we leave Skills Matter and move to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to continue the evening.  We finish the talks at about 8pm, so if you only want to attend this informal part aim to be at the pub by about 8:10 and you should be just in time to fight with us for room at the bar.

Registration <a name="nov14registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6695-lrug-november-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6695-lrug-november-meetup).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-november/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

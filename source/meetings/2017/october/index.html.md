The October 2017 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of October*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between
Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills
Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details are
given below](#oct17registration).

## Agenda

### Work Smart, Not Hard

[Paula Muldoon](https://twitter.com/FiddlersCode) says:

> Work Smart, Not Hard draws on Paula’s experience as an international
> violinist and Makers Academy alumna to promote practices that lead to code
> that’s well-designed, extensible, easy to debug, and enjoyable to write.

### Splitting strings

[Chris Zetter](https://twitter.com/czetter) says:

> I'll be talking about a bug I caused that led me on a journey of software
> archaeology. I'll be sharing what I discovered along the way.

### Making a Ruby with Lisp Syntax

[Emily Woods](https://twitter.com/emily_m_woods) says:

> I'll be discussing compiler design and sharing my experiences of designing a
> Lisp-like language which compiles to Ruby.

## Afterwards

The talks will take us to 8pm or thereabouts.  The end of the talks doesn't
have to be the end of the evening though.  We suggest you choose one of
the following venues if you want to keep chatting to your fellow LRUG
attendees:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

## Venue & Registration {#oct17registration}

[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

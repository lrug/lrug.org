The April 2017 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 10th of April*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between
Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills
Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details are
given below](#apr17registration).

## Agenda

We are a third of the way into the year, and now is the perfect time to
spring-clean the cobwebs from your mind palace with three excellent talks from
our community:

### Mobile Journey at FreeAgent

[Ioan Serban](https://twitter.com/dragossh)

> Taking a journey from 2012 to the present, you will find out how FreeAgent
> ended up with a hybrid App Store solution and the process involved in
> building & shipping it: our initial Rails-based explorations, the making
> of a hybrid app, how we structure the codebase, using the Asset Pipeline
> to compile & deploy a non-Rails app, moving from CoffeeScript to ES6, and
> whether the Asset Pipeline is a good fit for such an app.

### Live Coding

> A whirlwind exploration of how ’going live’ either online (all the rage on
> social media!) or in the flesh is being applied to coding.

### Practical hypermedia APIs in Ruby

> What matters, what doesn’t, and what implications the approach might have
> on the way you design server code, client implementations and documentation.

### Ticket Giveaway

{::sponsor name="FreeAgent" size="main" /}

The nice people at [FreeAgent](https://freeagent.com/) have provided 3 tickets for [Brighton Ruby conference](http://brightonruby.com/), a one day, single track, conference for Rubyists in Brighton on the 7th July. The tickets are being raffled off on our [mailing list](/mailing-list).  Thanks [FreeAgent](https://freeagent.com/)!


## Afterwards

The more-structured part of the meeting ends at 8pm, but that doesn't mean your
Ruby-related fun needs to end.  Amidst the near-infinite sea of possibilities
that London offers you, we can recommend winding down the evening and chatting
to other LRUG attendees in either of these locations:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosing on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

## Venue & Registration {#apr17registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

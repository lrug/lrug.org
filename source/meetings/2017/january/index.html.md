The first LRUG meeting of 2017 will be on *Monday the 9th of January*, from

Node](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between
Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills
Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details
are given below](#jan17registration).

## Agenda

### A developer's misadventures in business

[Najaf Ali](https://twitter.com/alinajaf) says:

> I am a developer who started a web application development consultancy. This
> talk is about the story of the business so far, some business basics I had
> to learn for the business to survive, and things you can do to better
> understand business, whether or not you intend to start one yourself.

### A guide to connascence

[Tom Cartwright](https://twitter.com/tomcartwrightuk) says:

> Connascence is a useful software quality metric that helps you identify
> the types and strengths of coupling within a system. I will show you how to
> assess connascence and I'll suggest how using the metric can help you improve
> the quality of your code.

## Afterwards

We aim to finish up the talks and formal part of the meeting by 8pm, but that
doesn't mean you have to go home.  Even if you are observing a January detox
you can still choose to hang out with other attendees at one of the following
venues:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosing on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8502-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup).  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8502-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup).

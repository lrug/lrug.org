## Agenda

As is traditional, our February meeting consists entirely of lightning talks of
no more than 10 minutes.  This year we have:

### Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes: Avoiding mutable state in Ruby and why you might want to

[Tom Wey](https://twitter.com/tjmwy) says:

> A few examples and techniques for avoiding mutable state in Ruby, and
> how this might make your code clearer and easier to test. Slightly
> inspired by getting more into functional programming languages.

### A way to think about bugs

[Amy Phillips](https://twitter.com/itjustbroke) says:

> Bugs. Bugs reports. Jira. Dirty, dirty words. Or are they? In this
> alternative view of bugs we'll see how bug reports can be turned into
> something positive for developers and development teams. Treated right a bug
> report can be a powerful trigger for changing technology, process, and even
> yourself.

### Logstash: JRuby and Java at Elastic

[Guy Boertje](https://twitter.com/guyboertje) says:

> I will talk for a bit about what it is like to develop
> [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), a data ingestion
> application, part of the open source Elastic Stack. At 12+ million downloads
> and tens of thousands of daily users, Logstash is very popular. We
> manage/code 160+ Github repos.

### A (Pointed) Guide to Beer

[Kaitlyn Tierney](https://twitter.com/krtierney) says:

> There are hundreds of beer styles from all over the world. This very brief
> introduction to beer will enumerate a few of them: how theyâ€™re made, what
> they taste like, and when to drink them.

{::coverage year="2017" month="february" talk="a-pointed-guide-to-beer" /}

### Base WTF

[Paul Battley](https://twitter.com/threedaymonk) says:

> If you've done much programming, you've probably worked with binary,
> hexadecimal, and perhaps octal in addition to normal decimal numbers. But
> what about base three? And what about base three with a twist, where each
> digit can be positive or negative? Why would you even want to do that? It
> really exists, it's called Balanced Ternary, and it has some interesting
> properties.

### Doing bad things in Postgres for fun and profit

[Ryan MacGillivray](https://twitter.com/RyanMacG) says:

> A brief glimpse at the unwise things you can do with the Postgres array
> datatype.

### <strike>My Live Coding Adventure</strike>

<strike><a href="https://twitter.com/rosaemerald">Rosa Fox</a> says:</strike>

> <strike>An experiment to see if live coding can make me a better developer.</strike>

Rosa has had to cancel due to illness, we hope to reschedule her talk for a later meeting.

## Afterwards

We aim to finish up the talks and formal part of the meeting by 8pm, but that
doesn't mean you have to go home.  There's bound to be something to talk about
after all those talks and we have two options for winding down the evening and
chatting to other LRUG attendees:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosing on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

## Venue & Registration {#feb17registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8503-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup).  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8503-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup).

Agenda
------

### Everyday cryptography - talking about crypto without complex maths

[Xavier Riley](https://twitter.com/xavriley) says:

> Good cryptography is hard, but learning the basic concepts don't have to
> have to be. By focussing on the key concepts, rather than the exotic maths,
> I hope we can initiate more people into understanding what good security
> looks like without having to take a University course. For those who already
> know their MACs from their IKEs, I hope this talk offers some useful ways
> of communicating these concepts to colleagues, friends and family.


### Fun with an Amazon Echo, Ruby and Recipes

[Miles Woodroffe](https://twitter.com/tapster) says:

> Voice interfaces open up so many interesting possibilities and in this talk
> I'll show you how to very quickly build and deploy a useful "skill" with
> Ruby, and at the same time, make sure you hopefully don't burn the dinner.

### How I met "Double Dutch" and he helped to remedy fear of injection.

[Marek Labos](https://twitter.com/marek_public) says:

> The story about how ideas from other languages can help us write
> simple, elegant Ruby code.  In this presentation we will look at a Double Dispatch pattern,
> Excel(spreadsheet) injection, how they go together and why fighting
> (accidental) code complexity matters.

Afterwards
----------

We aim to finish up the talks by 8pm and if you'd like to socialise with other
LRUG attendees afterwards you have two choices:

1. [Code Node][skills-matter-venue].  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If you can't attend the talks we'd still be very happy to see you at this part
of the meeting.  Do come along!

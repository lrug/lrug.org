## Agenda

### Better scripting with Crystal

[Lorenzo Barasti](https://twitter.com/lbarasti) says:

> What are the benefits of porting existing Ruby scripts to Crystal?
>
> How can writing scripts from scratch in Crystal impact our productivity?
>
> We'll explore these questions and highlight differences and similarities between the two languages in the process.

### Pushing Jekyll to breaking point

[James Smith](https://twitter.com/floppy) says:

> Jekyll is a static web development tool, used by GitHub Pages. Most uses are pretty simple, but you can do a lot more complex things with it too.
>
> This talk will explain how I’ve used git submodules, deeply nested JSON, CSV data, and other techniques to produce complex data-driven sites with rich output, all on GitHub Pages in vanilla Jekyll.
>
> It will also explain why some of this is a *really* bad idea, and reveal the true horror of some of the code required :)

### Building a webserver in Elixir

[Peter Saxton](https://twitter.com/crowdhailer) says:

> To a Ruby developer Elixir can seam like one of an overwhelming selection of trendy new languages. Elixir's lightweight processes mark it as unusual among these new languages, and give it a unique set of strengths.
>
> This talk explores the virtues of Elixir processes and demonstrates how to work with them.
>
> Finally we will take a deeper dive into a real world example; constructing a capable webserver.

## Afterwards

The talks should be finished by 8pm. After that, you’ve got two main options if
you want to keep chatting to other LRUG attendees:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

## Venue & Registration {#jul17registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

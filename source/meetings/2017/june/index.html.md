## Agenda

### This Code Sucks — A Story About Nonviolent Programming

[Nadia Odunayo](https://twitter.com/nodunayo) says:

> Think about something that happened at work recently. How did it make you feel? Why did it make you feel that way?
>
> Chances are you answered those two questions poorly. Our inability to answer such questions effectively leads us to communicate in ways that are negative and unhelpful.
>
> Let’s explore a day in the life of a fictional programmer who, just like us, means well and wants to do a great job. We’ll use our protagonist’s story to learn about how to honestly express our needs and effectively collaborate in disagreement.

### Choosing Ruby for a New Startup

[Alex McLintock](https://twitter.com/alexmc6) says:

> In 2016 I needed to pick the right set of tools for my web based startup, but Ruby on Rails was not my first choice. I will talk about some of the questions I asked myself as a C++/Perl/Java developer and some of the Ruby tools I picked.

### Food and Drinks

{::sponsor name="BookingBug" size="main" /}

The nice people at [BookingBug](https://www.bookingbug.co.uk/) have arranged to
provide us with some pizza and drinks. These will be available before the
meeting in the Skills Matter downstairs bar area. BookingBug is one of the UK's
(and Europe's) fastest-growing tech companies, and they're proud of their great
working culture and the learning & growth opportunities they offer. They're
hiring and keen to speak with Ruby on Rails developers looking for their next
challenge.

Thanks for supporting us [BookingBug](https://www.bookingbug.co.uk/)!

## Afterwards

The talks should be finished by 8pm. After that, you’ve got two main options if
you want to keep chatting to other LRUG attendees:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

## Venue & Registration {#jun17registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

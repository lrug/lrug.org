Agenda
------

### Let the Cats out of the bag

[Adam Lancaster](https://twitter.com/ItizAdz) says:

> A talk about cats, boxes and category theory.  Do you lie awake at night
> thinking about monads? Do you wonder why the identity of the exclusive
> `OR` Monoid is false? No, of course not... because you're still not sure
> what the hell they are! Allow me to explain with a beginner friendly
> introduction to Category Theory - with cats! And may your dreams once
> again be full of maths.

### Empathetech

[Lola Odelola](https://twitter.com/lolaodelola) has been looking at the role empathy
plays in technology and is going to tell us all about it.

### GraphQL in Ruby

[Phil Cowans](https://twitter.com/philcowans) and [Darren
Oakley](https://twitter.com/dazoakley) want to explain GraphQL to us:

> At Nested we've recently moved from traditional RESTful APIs to a Ruby
> GraphQL back end. In this talk we'll share our experience making the
> transition and using GraphQL for a real-world app.

### Why Writing Software Is Nothing Like Building A House

[Patrick Gleeson](http://patrickgleeson.com/) says:

> A brief exploration of the problems intrinsic to software project
> management, and a couple of suggestions for how we coders can help
> our non-technical colleagues get round them.

Afterwards
----------

The talks will take us to 8pm or thereabouts.  The end of the talks doesn't
have to be the end of the evening though.  We suggest you choose one of
the following venues if you want to keep chatting to your fellow LRUG
attendees:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

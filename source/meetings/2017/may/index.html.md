Agenda
------

### 5 Things I wish my grandfather told me about ActiveRecord and Postgres

[Ken Fassone](https://twitter.com/nexusventuri)

> Common gotchas, how to measure and improve performances when the database is
> the bottleneck.


### A Brief (and incomplete) introduction to Rust (for Rubyists)

[David Wickes](https://twitter.com/gypsydave5)

> Rust! It's the latest flavour of the month. Find out about this friendly
> low-level language, why rockstar Rubyists like Yehuda Katz and Steve Klabnik
> like it, and how to embed it in your Ruby code to get a bigger speed boost
> than those shiny stars in Mariokart.


### Do you even declarative?

[John Cinnamond](https://twitter.com/jcinnamond)

> A reflection on some recent tweets about declarative programming by Sarah Mei,
> and a look at the broader idea of the relationship between mathematics and
> computing.

Afterwards
----------

The more-structured part of the meeting ends at 8pm, but that doesn't mean your
Ruby-related fun needs to end.  Amidst the near-infinite sea of possibilities
that London offers you, we can recommend winding down the evening and chatting
to other LRUG attendees in either of these locations:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

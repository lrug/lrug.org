The March 2017 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 13th of March*,
from _6:00pm_ to _8:00pm_ (talks start at _6:30pm_).  The venue, [Code
Node](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between
Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills
Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details are
given below](#mar17registration).

## Agenda

After the flurry of February's traditional lightning talks, we're back to the
regular format, with three talks for your enjoyment:

### Action Cable vs. MessageBus - Live updates tailored for Rails

> Comparison between Action Cable and MessageBus for live updates in Rails
> application. Introduction to both solutions, basic implementation and benchmarks.

### The story of the not-so dark magic of application preloading

[Philipp Fehre](https://twitter.com/ischi)

> Many of us use application pre-loaders like zeus or spring, but how do they
> actually work? Lets step through what is actually going on by the example of zeus.

## Afterwards

We aim to finish up the talks and formal part of the meeting by 8pm, but that
doesn't mean you have to go home.  Why not celebrate our headlong rush towards
the vernal equinox by selecting one of two very fine options for winding down
the evening and chatting to other LRUG attendees:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosing on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter][skills-matter-event].  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

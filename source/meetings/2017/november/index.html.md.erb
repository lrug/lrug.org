## Agenda

### OpenPolitics: making policy with open source ideas

[James Smith](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/james-smith) says:

> The OpenPolitics project is a collaborative political policy-writing
> platform. Started as an experiment in using open source principles
> outside the world of tech, itâ€™s grown into a tool (written in Ruby)
> that allows anyone with a good idea to take a direct role in writing
> policy. This talk will explain how the project started, how the system
> evolved, and how it currently works atop git and GitHub to make open
> source workflows democratic and accessible by non-developers.

### Mock objects: delicious and addictive

[Duncan Brown](https://twitter.com/duncanjbrown) says:

> You must mock, but where do you begin? Where do you end? And how do you know > when to stop? A cautionary tale. I will talk about the mocking library
> [stripe-ruby-mock](https://github.com/rebelidealist/stripe-ruby-mock).

### 5 ways to keep docs up to date

[Tijmen Brommet](https://twitter.com/tijmenbr) says:

> Project documentation often falls into a cycle of disrepair: it's
> not read because it's not up to date, and not up to date because
> nobody reads it. This is a talk about how we tried to break that
> cycle for GOV.UK's internal developer documentation. I'll cover what
> we tried, what works & what doesn't, and how to employ a punny chat
> bot to help you.

## Afterwards

The talks will take us to 8pm or thereabouts.  The end of the talks doesn't
have to be the end of the evening though.  We suggest you choose one of
the following venues if you want to keep chatting to your fellow LRUG
attendees:

1. Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
   you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
   hosting on the same night.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/).  This bar is a short walk
   north from Code Node (you can find it at [1 City Road, EC1Y
   1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
   as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
   while the evening away.

Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) even though it does seem more
informal.

If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!

make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter][skills-matter-event].

The October meeting will be on *Monday* the 11th of October, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#oct10registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Cucumber Workshop

This month we'll be having a [Cucumber](http://cuckes.info) special.

[Joseph Wilk](http://josephwilk.net/) will be sharing his experiences on how you should and
shouldn't use Cucumber to test your applications, but rather than a
straight forward presentation with him boring everyone with lots of
long winded slides he's going to run the evening in a workshop format.
Consider it a self help group for Cucumber users where we all get to
share things that have and have not worked for us.

There will be some introduction patterns and case studies of good
Cucumber practices that he's come across to get things rolling. Coming
armed with your own ideas, experiences or complaints will help prevent
us all staring at the floor and shuffling our feet.

So if you're using Cucumber and are having problems, if you are not
yet sold on it and want some tips, if you think its the source of all
evil in the world, head along to this self help group. It would be
great if people could share some of the ideas you have brewing in your
mind before hand. Just get in touch with [Joseph directly](http://twitter.com/josephwilk) or [via the LRUG mailing list](/mailing-list) and help make this a Cuketastic (sorry) workshop!

### "Analogue Blog"

We start the meetings with short announcements about anything and everything that the group might be interested in.  We announce when people are hiring, we announce new conferences that people might want to attend or present at, we announce interesting blog posts to spark debate in the pub afterwards.  Anything goes really!  You don't have to ask for permission, just get up and say your piece, but keep it quick so you don't run on into the time for the scheduled talks.  In fact if it's longer than a minute, maybe you should think about [doing a longer talk](/speaking/).

## Pub

At the end of Joseph's cucumber workshop we'll all head on over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to continue the meeting in more informal surroundings.  The main meeting should finish around 8pm, so you'll find us ordering our drinks at the bar shortly after.  If you don't think you can make it for the workshop you really should think about coming along for drinks later on, as no doubt there'll be lots of interesting cucumber chat in the pub.  And maybe a few [interesting cucumber drinks too](http://www.hendricksgin.com/#/uk/treasury/cucumber/).

## Registration {#oct10registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/cucumber-workshop/rl-311) if you are coming to the meeting.  On a few exceptional occasions we've had to turn away people who haven't registered, but this has only been at extremely popular meetings, and has yet to happen at the new venue on Goswell Road.  It's better to be safe than sorry though, and it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/cucumber-workshop/rl-311).

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/7094687/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

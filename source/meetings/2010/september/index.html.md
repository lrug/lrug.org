The September meeting will be on *Monday* the 13th of September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#sep10registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Rails 3 Internals

[Priit Tamboom](http://priit.mx.ee/) would like to talk about Rails 3 internals:

> Recently I have been porting an app into Rails 3 and probably you have
> also been poking this new Rails 3 with ruby 1.9.2.
>
> Therefore I would like to discuss a bit more about Rails 3 itself.
> Particularly, things under railties lib directory covering classes
> such as Railtie, Engine, Application and will go through
> initialization with initializers.
>
> Along the way I'll show some examples how you can use this knowledge
> in your own gem or plugin.
>
> Nothing too fancy but should be useful for developing your next Rails
> 3 project.

A video of Priit's talk, filmed by Skills Matter, [is available on the Skills Matter site](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/rails-3-internals).

### Asynchronous interfaces

[Alex MacCaw](http://www.eribium.org/) will talk about moving state to the client side as opposed to the more traditional request/response model.  He'll go through the various options, such as [Syncro](http://github.com/maccman/syncro) (the successor to Juggernaut), and [SuperApp](http://github.com/maccman/superapp) (his JS framework).

### "Analogue Blog"

We start the meetings with announcements for the group.  If there's something you think the group should know, or something you're looking for help with, this is the time to say it.  You don't have to ask for permission, just get up and say your piece.  Just keep it short so you don't eat into the time for the scheduled talks.  In fact if it's longer than a minute, maybe you should think about [doing a longer talk](/speaking/).

## Pub

When all the talking is over we break ranks and head out for some beer.  Our chosen pub [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) which is about 5 minutes from the Skills Matter office.  The main meeting finishes around 8pm and you'll find us joslting for service at the bar shortly after.  If you don't think you can make it for the talks, you should come along for the beers, as the talks are really just an excuse for going to the pub afterwards.

Registration <a name="sep10registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/rails-3-internals/rl-890) if you are coming to the meeting.  On a few exceptional occasions we've had to turn away people who haven't registered, but this has only been at extremely popular meetings, and has yet to happen at the new venue on Goswell Road.  It's better to be safe than sorry though, and it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/rails-3-internals/rl-890).

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/6640513/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

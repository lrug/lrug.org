The May meeting will be on Wednesday the 12th of May, from <strike>6:30pm to 8:00pm</strike><strong>7:00pm to 8:30pm</strong>.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#may10registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### (j)ruby profilers

[Dan Lucraft](http://danlucraft.com/) is going to talk to us about ruby profilers, specifically his [jruby-prof](http://github.com/danlucraft/jruby-prof) gem.  Even though his gem is for [jruby](http://jruby.org/) only, he's going to give us a good grounding on "pure" ruby profilers first.

### Tokyo Cabinet, Tokyo Tyrant and Kyoto Cabinet: the world of [Mikio](http://1978th.net/) ware

[Makoto Inoue](http://twitter.com/makoto_inoue) gave a short talk at the recent [nosqleu conference](http://nosqleu.com/) about Tokyo Cabinet and he offered to give a slightly retooled (and more ruby focussed) version of that talk for us.  The blurb for his original talk is as follows:

> [Tokyo Cabinet](http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/) is one of the first "Key Value"
> stores. It was released in 2007, but surprisingly small number of people knows
> what it is really capable of. Makoto, the maintainer of
> [Tokyo Cabinet Wiki](http://tokyocabinetwiki.pbworks.com) will unveil
> the core philosophy and exciting features behind these products.

### UNIX: Rediscovering the wheel

[John Leach](http://johnleach.co.uk/) kindly offered to do a version of this talk (previously given at [Conferencia Rails 2009](http://www.conferenciarails.org/) and [Scottish Ruby Conference 2010](http://scottishrubyconference.com/)), but unfortunately he had to pull out at the last minute due to a double booking.  We'll try to reschedule this talk for a future meeting.

### Analogue Blog

There'll always be time at the start of the meeting (and between the speakers) for anyone in the group to get up and say something.  Use this time to let us know about anything you think is relevant to the group: maybe announce that your awesome team is hiring, or that you've just released a really interesting gem, or draw people's attention to a controversial blog post, or event to ask for some help working on a personal project.  It's really up to you what you say, just keep it short because we don't want to eat into the time for the scheduled talks.

## Pub

We aim to finish at about <strong>8:30pm</strong>, after which we make the short walk from Skills Matter's offices to our watering hole of choice: [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  Even if you can't make the formal part of the evening, you know where we are if you want to pop along for some of the more informal chat.  You'll be more than welcome.

## Registration {#may10registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/may-2010-lrug-meeting) if you are planning to come to the meeting.  If you forget to register it's unlikely that you'd be turned away at the door, but it has happened before when we've been *really* busy.  Even without the worry of being turned away hanging over your head, it's useful for fire regulations and to help our hosts arrange the room properly.  And most importantly it's simple manners (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/may-2010-lrug-meeting).

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/5750484/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

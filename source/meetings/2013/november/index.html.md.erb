## Agenda

### Controlling Robots with Ruby

[Andrew Nesbitt](http://nesbitt.io/) says:

> In the past few years robots have started to invade our lives, as
> toys or tools for around the home or at work. These robots are
> often much more user friendly and more importantly, hackable, than
> traditional industrial robots, which has lowered the barrier to
> writing software to control robots.
>
> We'll look at one particular ruby library, [Artoo](http://artoo.io/), a micro-framework
> for robotics that lets you connect to multiple different hardware
> devices and robots at the same time with some live demos as well.

### How to parse 'go'

[Tom Cartwright](http://www.tomcartwright.net/) says:

> Ruby is not the first language you might think turn
> to when tackling natural language processing problems.
> But it has a lot of features that make it suitable
> for NLP tasks and a number of gems are being actively
> maintained. This talk introduces those features and gems
> and discusses how you can build solutions to your
> language processing problems within your Ruby-based apps.

## Pub

After the talks many of us head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to continue the evening.  The speakers are usually there, so it's a perfect opportunity to ask them more in-depth questions about their talk, or just thank them for their effort.  If you can't make the talks, it's totally fine to just come along for this part of the meeting; we get there about 8pm.

## Registration {#nov13registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/november-lrug-meeting).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/november-lrug-meeting).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-november/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

The September 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 9th of September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#sep13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Concerned about Concerns?

[Luismi Cavallé](https://twitter.com/cavalle) wants to relieve our concerns:

> With Rails 4, Concerns have become [the “official” solution](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3372-put-chubby-models-on-a-diet-with-concerns)
> to the big-models problem. However, there's a fair amount
> of controversy about this topic in the community. Not 
> everyone is convinced that Concerns are the “right“ solution
> to the problem of AR models becoming too big.
> 
> In this talk we will see what Rails Concerns are and how can 
> we use them to keep our models fit. More interestingly, we'll
> discuss the trade-offs of this technique, the different views
> in the community and a couple of alternatives.

### Scaling beyond Rails

[Manuel Morales](https://github.com/manuelmorales) says:

> When a Rails application becomes a big fat monster, the moment 
> arrives to split it into small services that speak to each other. 
> I'll discuss how are we attacking this problem in a progressive, 
> iterative way and which tools we chose for each situation; some of 
> which are not limited to Ruby.

## Pub

Our talks finish at roughly 8pm and we move on to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) for the rest of the evening.  This is your chance to talk to the speakers without the rest of the crowd scrutinising your questions, and to talk to the rest of the crowd without interrupting the speakers.  If you can't make it for the talks, perhaps because you <a href="#sep13registration">didn't register in time</a>, then do turn up just for the pub bit.

## Registration {#sep13registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/concerned-about-concerns).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/concerned-about-concerns).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-september/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

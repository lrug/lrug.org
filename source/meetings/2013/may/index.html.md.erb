The May 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 13th of May, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#may13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### DCI with Ruby & Rails

[Dawid SkÅ‚odowski](http://dawid.sklodowski.eu/) says:

> Data Context Interaction is recently invented programming paradigm,
> which aims at separating behaviour from data model, by extracting
> interactions into roles, which can be played by objects in various
> contexts.
>
> This presentation is going to give brief introduction to DCI,
> propose ways to implement roles' injection in Ruby and discuss
> how DCI could be used to supplement Rails' MVC paradigm.

### Come get dirty with mruby

[Randy Morgan](https://github.com/randym) is going to lead us in an exploration of [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby):

> While most of us know what mruby is, few of us have had a
> chance to kick the tires, poke around a bit and see what
> makes it tick. In this ~30 minute workshop-presentation,
> we will help each other to get mruby built locally, do a
> classic "Chunky bacon" test, and have a go at writing our
> own rbgems to extend the language with custom functionality.
>
> Bring your laptop, and get your hands dirty with mruby.

Randy will be sending out instructions on pre-requisites in a few days to [the mailing list](/mailing-list). Don't miss it!

### Drinks

{::sponsor name="Team Prime" size="main" /}

Also, the nice folks at [Team Prime](http://www.team-prime.com/) are providing some drinks during the talks, so there are even more reasons to make it along!  There'll be a range of beers and soft drinks available.

## Pub

The talks usually finish up around 8pm, but that's not the end of the meeting!  We continue at [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) which is about 5 minutes away.  Attendance at the talks is not a requirement on coming to the pub, so if you can't make it to them do feel free to turn up afterwards!

## Registration {#may13registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/dci-with-ruby-rails).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/dci-with-ruby-rails).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-may/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

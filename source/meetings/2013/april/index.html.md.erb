The April 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 8th of April, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#apr13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Better security for your web applications

[Najaf Ali](http://happybearsoftware.com) wants to school us on security:

> He'll be covering:
>
> * How to improve the quality of your software by thinking like an attacker.
> * Technical walkthroughs of real-life vulnerabilities.
> * Practical tips for keeping your software secure over the long term.

### Say hello to Padrino

[Xavier Riley](https://twitter.com/xavriley) is going to tell us all about [Padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/):

> Rails showed us the power of the full-stack framework.
> It was good, but some of us felt the power was at the
> expense of lightness (and joy?).
>
> Sinatra showed us the joy of simple. The bare essentials
> to start working with http requests gave us back some
> of the Zen of creating a codebase that did exactly what
> it should and nothing more. Sadly, this Zen meant
> reinventing wheels that Rails had already rolled.
>
> Padrino came after both of these projects and the
> developers learnt from them. They re-imagined the
> full stack using Sinatra as a base and building from
> there. Sinatra++ you might think.

There's a longer write up on the [Ruby Manor 4 vestibule](http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/proposals/47) where Xavier originally proposed the talk.

## Pub

After the talks we head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) for a drink or two and the opportunity to chat.  If you're unlucky enough to be unable to make the talks, you are more than welcome at the bar.

## Registration {#apr13registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/london-ruby-april).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/london-ruby-april).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-april/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

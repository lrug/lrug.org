The March 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 11th of March, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#mar13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### deliver

[Gerhard Lazu](http://gerhardlazu.com/) will be showing off a new project of his called [deliver](https://github.com/gerhard/deliver):

> I will be speaking about app deployment, good production
> practices, CI and CD and app versioning (never replace a
> working production app instance with a new deploy).
> [deliver](https://github.com/gerhard/deliver) is a single
> utility to rule one's deploys to gh:pages, Jekyll, Ruby,
> node.js etc, even legacy PHP code (we all have it). The
> talk will also touch on S3-backed site deploys & Route53
> IP failover to that S3 site.

### Passing on our skills to the next generation

[Pablo Brasero Moreno](http://pablobm.com/) says:

> I will share my experience teaching programming to children
> for a month. I will also tell us about "code clubs" in the
> UK, and what technologies exist to assist teachers in
> this task.

## Pub

We're a friendly bunch, so if you don't make it to the talks you can still join us for a drink afterwards.  The talks normally finish up by 8pm and you can find us crowding the bar at [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) shortly after.

Also, the nice folks at [House Trip](http://www.housetrip.com/) are sponsoring some drinks behind the bar, so there are even more reasons to make it along!

---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter]( http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-march-1645).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter]( http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-march-1645).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-march/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

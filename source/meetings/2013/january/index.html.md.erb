The January 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 14th of January, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#jan13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Pub quiz!

To ease us into 2013, [Murray Steele](http://h-lame.com/) will be running a pub quiz.  We last did a pub quiz meeting way back in [2007](/meetings/2007/january/) and it felt like it was about time to revisit it.  Also, it provides an easy template for us to copy:

The quiz format will be as follows:

* Round 1: *L*ondon
* Round 2: *R*uby (community and history)
* Round 3: *U*sers (famous folk)
* Round 4: *G*roup (music)
* Round 5: picture round (a hand out to complete during the other rounds)

Teams should have no more than 4 members.  Utilising internet devices to obtain answers will be severely frowned upon.  There will be extra points available for best team name.

##### Prizes

There will be prizes for the winning teams:

* annual subscriptions to [Railscasts Pro](http://railscasts.com/pro) provided by {::sponsor name="Railscasts" size="main" /}
* Books and ebook download vouchers provided by {::sponsor name="O'Reilly" size="main" /}
* $25 vouchers for [Avdi Grimm's store](https://shiprise.dpdcart.com/) provided by {::sponsor name="Avdi Grimm" size="main" /}
* Download vouchers for 3 [peepcode screencasts](https://peepcode.com/screencasts/) provided by {::sponsor name="Peepcode" size="main" /}

#### Drinks

During the pub quiz there will be a range of drinks available (soft drinks, as well as alcohol).  These drinks are available thanks to sponsorship provided by:

* Go Free Range {::sponsor name="Go Free Range" size="main" /}
* AdRoc Group {::sponsor name="AdRoc Group" size="main" /}
* Unboxed Consulting {::sponsor name="Unboxed Consulting" size="main" /}
* vzaar {::sponsor name="vzaar" size="main" /}

## Pub

When the quiz ends and the prizes have been handed out, those with an appetite to continue the pub element of the quiz will head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  If you can't make the quiz, do feel free to turn up just to the pub later on.  Our normal meetings end no later than 8pm, but the quiz may run on a bit.

## Registration {#jan13registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/a-pub-quiz-with-a-twist-of-ruby).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/a-pub-quiz-with-a-twist-of-ruby).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-january/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

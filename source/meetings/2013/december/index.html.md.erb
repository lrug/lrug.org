The December 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of December*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#dec13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### The solution to assets management in Rails

[Tymon Tobolski](http://teamon.eu/) from [DRUG](http://drug.org.pl/) is visiting and wants to talk to us about asset management:

> As Ruby web developers we all know the pain of managing client
> side assets in (not only) Rails applications, especially in legacy
> applications. I have had enough and that's how [http://rails-assets.org](http://rails-assets.org)
> was born. The main purpose of this talk, besides spreading the
> word, is to show some details of how rails-assets works and to
> compare it with existing solutions

### From a raw TCP socket to a Rails application

[Najaf Ali](http://najafali.com/) offers us this:

> Ruby and associated frameworks are notorious for employing
> magic in the name of developer productivity, especially when
> building web applications. In this talk I'm going to peel
> back the layers of voodoo and show you how we go from a raw
> TCP socket to a Rails app via rack applications and middleware.
>
> We'll be coving:
>
> * Very high level overview of TCP connections and a minimum
>   viable web server with netcat
> * Rack applications, middleware, and how they're typically chained
>   together
> * How Rails chains together rack middleware to do what it does
>   (i.e. tracing the code path of a request from class Railtie all
>   the way down to your apps controllers).
>
> There will be live coding, so I request that you sacrifice a
> llama or three in the name of the demo gods before the event.

### A FizzBuzz to rule them all

[Rosario Rascuna](http://rosario.io/) runs a site called [coder sumo](http://codersumo.com/) and wants to talk to us about some things he's learned:

> Do expressive programming languages influence how we approach a
> problem? We'll look at a few things you can learn about software
> developers after analysing 1500 FizzBuzz implementations.

## Pub

The talks end at around 8pm, but you'll find many attendees will continue the meeting by heading to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  This is a great place to grab a bite to eat and a drink and discuss the talks with the rest of the attendees and the speakers.  If you can't make the talks, do feel free to just turn up straight at the pub.

## Registration {#dec13registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-december-meet-up).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-december-meet-up).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-december/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

The August 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 12th of August, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#aug13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### Improve your code with dependency injection

[Stephen Best](https://twitter.com/thebestie) says:

> Most of us have heard the vague, hand waving spiel about why
> DI is important for writing flexible, reusable code, a
> little harder to come by are examples of how one actually
> goes about doing it in a (cost) effective manner.
>
> Rather than a dry introduction to DI, this talk will be
> packed full of code examples demonstrating practical
> techniques you can start using straight away, no gems,
> meta-programming or magic required. We'll also explore how
> you might persuade your Rails app to benefit from DI.

### Rabbit running wild? You need a hutch!

[Pete Hamilton](https://twitter.com/peterejhamilton) says:

> When you're working in an architecture with multiple
> services, there are a lot of available options for how to
> communicate between them. Which do you pick?
>
> I'll be talking about why [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) can be a great choice,
> how and why we're using it here at [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/) and covering
> some of the ways we've simplified using RabbitMQ's
> [Topic Exchange](http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchange-topic) in a ruby environment with 'Hutch'.
>
> I'll then talk about some of the issues we encountered
> around scaling and setting up multiple rabbit nodes as a
> cluster, highlighting some of the potential failure points
> and edge cases this brings with it and a tools we built to
> make sure we had them covered.

### Drinks!

During the talks there will be some drinks available, provided by the nice folks at [Team Prime](http://www.team-prime.com/).

Pub
---

The two talks will take us to about 8pm, at which point we move on from Skills Matter to the second venue of the evening: [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  There's no agenda here, just visit the bar and seek out those rubyists you've been meaning to say hi to for a while.  Attendance at the talks is obviously not required for attendance at the pub, so do come along anyway!

Registration <a name="aug13registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-hosts-stephen-best-pete-hamilton).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-hosts-stephen-best-pete-hamilton).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-august/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

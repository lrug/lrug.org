The April 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 14th of
April, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Board intelligence](https://www.boardintelligence.com/)
in [their offices][board-intelligence-venue], near Bank. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#april25registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

### Space for more talks

[You](mailto:talks@lrug.org), maybe?

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#april25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor][april2025-ticket-tailor]**.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Board Intelligence<br/>24 Cornhill<br/>City of London<br/>London<br/>EC3V 3ND<br/><br/>[See on a map]

The venue has a hard limit of 50 people. If you register and realise you can't come, please use TicketTailor to give up your

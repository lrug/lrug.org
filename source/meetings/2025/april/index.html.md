The April 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 14th of
April, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Board intelligence](https://www.boardintelligence.com/)
in [their offices][board-intelligence-venue], near Bank. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#april25registration).

## Agenda

### From React to Hotwire – An Unexpected Journey

[Maciej Korsan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciejkorsan/) says:

> For years, React has been the go-to choice for building frontend applications
> — but is it always the best solution? In this talk, I’ll share my journey from
> working extensively with React to discovering Hotwire, a radically different
> approach that enables dynamic applications without heavy JavaScript or complex
> state management.
>
> Rather than a theoretical comparison, I’ll walk through real-world examples,
> demonstrating how I’ve implemented interactive features using Hotwire. I’ll
> also discuss my experiences, the challenges I faced, and some surprising
> discoveries along the way.

### AI has many applications in our industry, we are just getting started

[Mario Gintili](https://github.com/shellandbull) says:

> AI has many applications in our industry, we are just getting started.
>
> In this talk, I'll explore an approach to AI-powered observability
> tooling that knows everything about you and your codebase.

> I'll demo some of the most recent tooling in AI-assisted development,
> show you how to enrich an LLM with highly relevant contextual information and
> display a little workflow that shows how to use AI to fix bugs faster as
> they happen in production.

### Space for more talks

[You](mailto:talks@lrug.org), maybe?

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#april25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our

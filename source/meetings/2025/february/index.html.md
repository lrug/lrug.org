The February 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 10th of
February, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Funding
Circle](https://fundingcircle.com) in [their offices][fc-venue], on Queen
Victoria St. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#feb25registration).

## Agenda

### Lightning Talks!

Our February meeting is our annual event devoted to short talks of no more
than 10 minutes.

We have space for 8 talks, and it is our most popular event of the year. So, if you have been on the fence about giving a talk, there is no better opportunity than this. To put yourself on the map, email us at [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org)

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#feb25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor][february2025-ticket-tailor]**.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Funding Circle<br/>71 Queen Victoria St<br/>London<br/>EC4V 4AY<br/><br/>[See on a map][fc-venue]

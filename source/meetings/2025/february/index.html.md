The February 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 10th of
February, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Funding
Circle](https://fundingcircle.com) in [their offices][fc-venue], on Queen
Victoria St. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#feb25registration).

## Agenda

### Lightning Talks!

Our February meeting is our annual event devoted to short talks of no more
than 10 minutes.

We have space for 3 more talks, and it is our most popular event of the year. So, if you have been on the fence about giving a talk, there is no better opportunity than this. To put yourself on the map, email us at [talks@lrug.org](mailto:talks@lrug.org)

### AI tools for programmers

[fell sunderland](https://www.fellsunder.land/) says:

> Why I don't use AI programming tools, and I don't think you should either.

### Why our schema files kept changing

David Lantos says:

> Tale of an investigation why a local `db:schema:load` would change our
> `db/schema.rb` for seemingly no reason. Spoiler: varchar index

### 10 years of RSpec in 10 minutes

[Jon Rowe](https://jonrowe.co.uk) will share:

> a brief look into the history of [RSpec](https://rspec.info) and a glance into the future.

### Rails 8 + AI = Happy Life for Lazy Engineer to Create a Walking Skeleton

Zhiqiang Bian says:

> In this talk, I’ll explore how Rails 8, combined with AI-assisted
> tools, can help engineers rapidly spin up a walking skeleton—a minimal
> yet functional end-to-end system—with minimal effort.

### Never Say, Never Say Die!

[Eleanor McHugh](https://slideshare.net/feyeleanor) says:

> Ruby is a high-level language, and there's a general assumption that
> it's ill-suited to low-level shenanigans. But is this true?
>
> In this lightning talk I'll introduce some basic Ruby tools for
> accessing low-level system features, concentrating on *nix platforms,
> and see if it's possible to replicate tenderlove's Never Say Die gem
> for recovering from segfaults.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#feb25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our

The May 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 12th of
May, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Space4](https://space4.tech/), near Finsbury Park. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#may25registration).

## Agenda

### An event-sourced programming model for Ruby

[Ismael Celis](https://ismaelcelis.com/) says:

> Exploring how Event Sourcing and Ruby can provide a cohesive programming
> model where auditable data, durable workflows and reactive UIs are the default.

### More spaces available

[You](mailto:talks@lrug.org), maybe?

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#may25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

The October 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of October
from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we'll be hosted by [Bloom &
Wild](https://www.bloomandwild.com/careers) in [their
offices][bloom-and-wild-venue] between Vauxhall and Oval tube stations. Not only will they be providing the space, they'll also be giving us some pizza and drinks!  [Full venue and registration
details are given below](#october25registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll head to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees. Last time we were hosted by
Bloom & Wild we visited [Mc & Sons](https://www.mcandsonsvauxhall.com), just
round the corner on Kennington Lane, which serves all the classic pub drinks to
wash down some Thai food.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

The March 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of
March, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

**We don't have a host yet!**

Please get in touch if you can offer your space. You can still [register below](#march25registration).

## Agenda


### Objects talking to objects

[Gavin Morrice](https://twitter.com/morriceGavin) says:

> A review on what makes OOP such an effective paradigm to work in, followed by a critical discussion on some of the newer design trends in the Ruby space. We will discuss the concerns of relying too heavily on these patterns, and alternative approaches.


## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#march25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

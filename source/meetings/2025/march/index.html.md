The March 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 10th of
March, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Explore Group](https://www.explore-group.com/)
in [their offices][explore-venue], near Aldgate. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#march25registration).

## Agenda


### Objects talking to objects

[Gavin Morrice](https://twitter.com/morriceGavin) says:

> A review on what makes OOP such an effective paradigm to work in, followed by a critical discussion on some of the newer design trends in the Ruby space. We will discuss the concerns of relying too heavily on these patterns, and alternative approaches.

### Unlocking the Awesome Power of Refactoring at Work

[Hemal Varambhia](https://github.com/hemalvarambhia) says:

> In this talk, I recount and discuss how I refactored some legacy ruby code using the Simple Design Dynamo and ideas from "Tidy First" to make it more agile, and then, using Domain-Driven Design, take that agility to the next level.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

The January 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of
January, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
in [their offices][canva-venue], on Hoxton Square. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#jan25registration).

## Agenda

### You?

We've secured a venue, but now we need content - could it be you?  How about some of these ideas:

* What's new in [ruby 3.4](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/NEWS_md.html)
* What's new in [rails 8.0](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/8_0_release_notes.html)
* Lessons learned from tackling this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in ruby
* A review of your favourite talks from [a bumper year of ruby content](https://ruby.social/@marcoroth/113665539397868492)
* `<%= all_possible_ideas.dig(:your, :idea) %>`

[Get in touch](mailto:talks@lrug.org) to volunteer!

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll move to a nearby pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.  Usually when we've visited Canva this has been [The George & Vulture](https://georgeandvulture.com) on Pitfield Street.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#jan25registration}

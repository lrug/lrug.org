The September 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 8th of September
from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we'll be hosted by [Vonage](https://developer.vonage.com/en/home) in [their offices][vonage-venue] in Shoreditch. They'll be spoiling us with food, drink and (if we behave) a raffle.

[Full venue and registration
details are given below](#september25registration). You will be asked to present a photo ID by building security so please come prepared.

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#september25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[sep2025-ticket-tailor]**.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Vonage<br/>3rd Floor<br/>15 Bonhill Street<br/>London<br/>EC2A 4DN<br/><br/>[See on a map][Vonage-venue]

Please use the street address and not just the postcode if searching on Google Maps

On arrival you will then be registered with building security and will be permitted up to the 3rd floor via the lifts, where we will greet you and assign you a visitorâ€™s badge, which you should wear at all times whilst in the building. You will be asked to present a photo ID so please come prepared.

The venue has a hard limit of 100 people.  If you register and realise you
can't come, please use tickettailor to give up your place so we can someone
else come in your place.  We might be able to let in people on the night
who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

The June 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of
May, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Judge.me](https://judge.me)
in their offices in Shoreditch. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#june25registration).

## Agenda

### Rethinking Service Objects in Ruby

[Vladimir Gorodulin](https://github.com/gorodulin/) says:

> Service Objects in Ruby can feel a bit off to use, so Iâ€™ll share some
> experiments insights on some pragmatic ways to make them work better by
> shifting toward a more procedural approach.

### You?

[You](mailto:talks@lrug.org?subject=I+have+a+talk+for+the+June+2025+LRUG+meeting) can say:

> Anything you'd like really, as long as it is of some interest to ruby
> programmers.  Get [some tips](https://readme.lrug.org/#subject-matter)

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more informal,
please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the meeting and
covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#june25registration}

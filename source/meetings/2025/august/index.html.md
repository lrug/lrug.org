The August 2025 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 11th of August,
from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

For the second month running, we're being hosted by the lovely folk at [Cleo](https://meetcleo.com) in [their offices][cleo-venue], on Shoreditch High St.

[Full venue and registration
details are given below](#august25registration).

## Agenda

### stepper_motor: effortless long-running workflows for Rails

[Julik Tarkhanov](https://blog.julik.nl) says:

> Lately, there has been a lot of development in durable workflows in
Rails with tools like active_job_continuation and acidic_job.
stepper_motor is a new tool allowing for identifiable, associable,
orchestrated step workflows for Rails applications - without gRPC, extra
tools or data stores. Let's explore where such a system comes from, why
every durable execution system is secretly a DAG, and how the
stepper_motor architecture is informed by VFX software instead of the
imperative ActiveJob methods.

### No Browser Required: Dynamic OpenGraph Images with Rails and Rust
[James Edwards-Jones](https://portfolio.jamedjo.co.uk/) says:

> How would you convert a `<div>` to a PNG? A technical deep dive into how
Himg generates images from HTML without using a browser.

> Our journey will include:

> * How a browser works: from CSS parsing to image rendering
* Practical tips: like how to call Rust from Ruby
* Rails internals: how rails calls render without you needing to ask
* Using the [Himg](https://github.com/Jamedjo/himg/) library
* Server side request forgery and injection attacks
* What OpenGraph images are and how they can help you go viral ðŸ¦‹

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#august25registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to the [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to
be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via ticket tailor]
[aug2025-ticket-tailor]**.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Cleo<br/>Unit 2.10, 2nd Floor<br/>Tea Building<br/>56 Shoreditch High St.<br/>London<br/>E1 6JJ<br/><br/>[See on a map][cleo-venue]

The venue has a hard limit of 60 people.  If you register and realise you
can't come, please use eventbrite to give up your place so we can someone
else come in your place.  We might be able to let in people on the night
who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

#### Accessibility info for the venue

Below you can find all the accessibility info for Cleo's office:

- There is step free access to enter the Tea Building from both entrances (Redchurch St and Bethnal Green Rd)
- There are stairs and a small open platform lift to get you from the Tea Building lobby to the lifts going up to the 2nd floor
- There are 2 lifts for transporting people to each floor of the Tea Building
- There is step-free access from the lifts to Cleo's office unit
- The double doors to the office may be opened to accommodate a wider wheelchair or motorised chair
- The main floor of our office is step free
- There is 1 accessible restroom in the office, and 6 restrooms in total

Now, there are a couple of caveats, which we hope will not deter anybody:

- The main doors into the Tea Building do not auto-open - they open inwards with a push
- The door to Cleo's office does not auto-open - it opens inwards with a push.

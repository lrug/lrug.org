The January 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of
January, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

**ðŸ‘ª in person meeting alert ðŸ‘ª**

Maybe next month we'll stop calling this out as a novelty, but for now
it's still potentially unusual so here we are. We're once again
in-person, this time we're hosted by the lovely folks at
[Unboxed](https://unboxed.co/) in [their offices][unboxed-venue], on
Commercial St, near Liverpool St., Aldgate East, and Shoreditch High St.
stations. [Full venue and registration details are given
below](#jan23registration).


## Agenda

### Heaping on the Complexity

[Matt Valentine-House](https://ruby.social/@eightbitraptor) says:

> Join me on a journey through Ruby's Garbage Collector!
>
> In this talk I'll teach you some of the details about how the Ruby
> interpreter manages memory. I'll introduce a project my team and I are
> working on that aims to make Ruby faster by improving its memory
> efficiency, and then we'll talk about how our implementation broke
> Garbage Collection.

> After that we'll go on a journey together, through some weeds, and
> taking a few bad turns until we finally emerge with a few PR's that
> not only Fix GC, but make our project better too.

###  What does "high priority" mean? The secret to happy queues

[Daniel Magliola](https://mobile.twitter.com/dmagliola)

> Like most web applications, you run important jobs in the background. And
> today, some of your urgent jobs are running late. Again. No matter how many
> changes you make to how you enqueue and run your jobs, the problem keeps
> happening. The good news is you're not alone. Most teams struggle with this
> problem, try more or less the same solutions, and have roughly the same
> result. In the end, it all boils down to one thing: keeping latency low. In
> this talk I will present a latency-focused approach to managing your queues
> reliably, keeping your jobs flowing and your users happy.

### Solargraph-rails in 2022

[Fritz Meissner](https://twitter.com/fritzmeissner)

> From chewing-gum-and-regex to 35,000 lines of code and YAML! Come hear
> about the past year of work on the solargraph-rails gem. You'll see new
> features, mostly from merging with the solargraph-ARC gem, and hear about
> the lessons learned along the way: more code means more to maintain and
> understand, but there's a surprising amount that can be done just by
> putting one foot in front of the other.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave Unboxed (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

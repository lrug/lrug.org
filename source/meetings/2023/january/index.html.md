The January 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 12th of
January, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

**ðŸ‘ª in person meeting alert ðŸ‘ª**

Maybe next month we'll stop calling this out as a novelty, but for now
it's still potentially unusual so here we are. We're once again
in-person, this time we're hosted by the lovely folks at
[Unboxed](https://unboxed.co/) in [their offices][unboxed-venue], on
Commercial St, near Liverpool St., Aldgate East, and Shoreditch High St.
stations. [Full venue and registration details are given
below](#jan23registration).


## Agenda

### ???

[Someone]() says:

> A talk?

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave Unboxed (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#jan23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all

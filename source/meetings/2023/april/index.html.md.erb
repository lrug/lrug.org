The April 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 17th of
April, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm). Note this is later in the month than we would normally hold the meeting, due to the Easter bank holiday.

This month we're hosted again by the
lovely folk at [Cleo](https://web.meetcleo.com/) at their offices, in Shoreditch. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#apr23registration).

## Agenda

###  Making a working upwards assignment operator

[Alex](https://alexwlchan.net/) says:

> Ruby has leftward assignment. It has rightward assignment. But what about upward assignment?
>
> In this talk, we’ll misuse Ruby’s internals to build an arrow operator that lets us assign upwards. We’ll see some powerful Ruby metaprogramming features that allow us to bend Ruby to our will – and we’ll talk about why it’s good to write code that’s just plain daft.

### Build a mini Ruby debugger in under 300 lines

[Stan Lo](https://github.com/st0012) says:

> As developers, we know that the best way to learn is by doing. Many of us have
> built mini-rails, mini-sinatra, and even mini-rubies. But have you ever built
> your own debugger?
>
> In this talk, I'll show you how to create a mini Ruby debugger that's both
> powerful and fun to use. You'll learn how to:
> - Run your program with debugger with a simple command
> - Set breakpoints and through debugger commands
> - Step through your code to find bugs
>
> And best of all, you'll do it all in under 300 lines of code!

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

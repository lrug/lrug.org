The October 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of
October, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Redcat Digital](https://www.redcat-digital.com) in [their offices][redcat-digital-venue] in Timber Yard on Drysdale Street. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#october23registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

### Your talk here!

Get in touch with us at talks@lrug.org if you'd like to speak. We're always happy to help new (or not so new) speakers.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#october23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via eventbrite][october-2023-eventbrite]**.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Redcat Digital<br/>Timber Yard<br/>115a Drysdale Street<br/>London<br/>N1 6ND<br/><br/>[See on a map][redcat-digital-venue]

The venue has a hard limit of *50 people*.  If you register and realise
you can't come, please use eventbrite to give up your place so someone
else can come in your place.  We might be able to let in people on the
night who haven't registered, but we can't guarantee it.

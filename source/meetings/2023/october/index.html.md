The October 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of
October, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Redcat Digital](https://www.redcat-digital.com) in [their offices][redcat-digital-venue] in Timber Yard on Drysdale Street. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#october23registration).

## Agenda

### BorrowMyDoggy - Connecting dogs and people via Ruby

[Rikke Rosenlund](https://www.borrowmydoggy.com/) says

> BorrowMyDoggy connects dog owners with local borrowers for walks,
> weekends and holidays. Via BorrowMyDoggy, borrowers get happy dog time,
> owners get help with taking care of their dogs, and dogs get more love
> and attention (it's a win-win scenario). We started by winning the Lean
> Startup Machine, then received a crazy amount of media attention and by
> now have built a community of +1 million members in the UK and Ireland,
> and are working with some of the biggest players in the pet space. Come
> and listen to how a simple idea has now turned into a well known brand.

### Your talk here!

Get in touch with us at talks@lrug.org if you'd like to speak. We're always happy to help new (or not so new) speakers.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#october23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

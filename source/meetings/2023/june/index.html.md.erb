The June 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 12th of
June, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Funding
Circle](https://fundingcircle.com) in [their offices][fc-venue], on Queen
Victoria St. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#jun23registration).

## Agenda

### Tech debt for the rest of us

[Alfredo Motta](https://twitter.com/mottalrd) says:

> Tech Debt can be messy, but it doesn't have to be. In this short talk
> I'll present a simple approach to identify your Tech Debt, monitor it
> over time and make it actionable.

### Mutation testing - study case

[Adam Piotrowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsarin/) says:

> Let's talk about why and how we measure our test coverage. If you are
> using line test coverage measurement and you are happy with it, please let
> me show you some differences and examples of line TC vs mutation TC.

### How we used CQRS to structure our new Borrower Portal

[Shenthuran Satkunarasa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shen-sat) says:

> Funding Circle recently built a new application that allows borrowers to
> manage their loans themselves. We structured the application using a
> (new-to-me!) design principle called Command Query
> Responsibility Segregation. Join me as I give a brief definition of what
> CQRS is before showing you the practical application of it via our new
> borrower portal ðŸ’»

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#jun23registration}

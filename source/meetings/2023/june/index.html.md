The June 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 12th of
June, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

## Agenda

### Tech debt for the rest of us

[Alfredo Motta](https://twitter.com/mottalrd) says:

> Tech Debt can be messy, but it doesn't have to be. In this short talk
> I'll present a simple approach to identify your Tech Debt, monitor it
> over time and make it actionable.

### Ruby to solve homelessness and the refugee crises

[Dan Hough](http://beam.org/) says:

> Social impact startup Beam (named by LinkedIn as one of the UK’s Top 15
> Startups) has built pioneering products for government, social care workers -
> and homeless people and refugees themselves. Together, Beam is proving that
> tech can solve these problems for good. Hear about how a small Engineering
> team has built software that has transformed the lives of thousands of
> homeless people and refugees. And hear about the fun, meaning and challenge in
> Tech for Good.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#jun23registration}

The September 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 11th of
September, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Smart]( https://www.smart.co/careers) in [their offices][smart-venue] on 136 George Street. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#september23registration).

## Agenda

### The Functional Alternative

[Ju Liu](https://juliu.is) says

> We'll start with a simple Ruby Kata and solve it together, live, with
> imperative programming.
> We'll then fix the many, many, many things we got wrong. Then we'll solve
> the problem again using patterns from functional programming. You'll leave
> this talk with a clear and concrete example of why functional programming
> matters, why immutable code matters, and why it can help you writing
> bug-free code.
> The next time you find yourself writing imperative code, you might
> consider... the functional alternative.

### Back in my day...

[Paul Battley](https://po-ru.com) says

> I've been working with Ruby since the early 2000s. Ruby has changed a lot in that time,
> but we don't always remember how much. Let's rewrite a short program so that it runs in
> a twenty-year-old version of Ruby and see how much syntax and performance has changed for the better in twenty years

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

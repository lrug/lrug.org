The December 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 11thth of
December, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/)
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#dec23registration).

## Agenda

### Test Smarter, Not Harder - Crafting a Test Selection Framework from Scratch

[Christian Bruckmayer](https://twitter.com/bruckmayer) says:

> The simplest way of running tests is to run all of them, regardless of what changes you are testing. However, depending on the size of your test suite, this will either get slow or expensive. At Shopify we have almost 300,000 Rails tests and we add 50,000 more annually. The sheer amount of tests and their growth makes it impossible to run all tests, all the time! Hence we implemented a framework to only run tests relevant to your code changes.

> We will build a test selection framework from scratch in this workshop. We will begin by exploring the fundamentals of such a framework: code analysis. After that we will dive into minitest reporters, how they work and how we can use them to generate a test map. Finally we will use the generated test map to only run tests relevant to your code changes. Attendees will walk away with a solid understanding of what test selection is, how it works and how to implement it.

This is a workshop, so bring your laptop!

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

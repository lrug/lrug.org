## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

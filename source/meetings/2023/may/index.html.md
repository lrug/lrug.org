The May 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 15th of
May, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/) in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#may23registration).

## Agenda

### GitHub Actions: an introduction

[Gus Shaw Stewart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gus-shaw-stewart-499409189/) says:

> An introductory talk about GitHub Actions - what they are, why they are
important, and how you can get started with them.


## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

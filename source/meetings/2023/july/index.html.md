The July 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 10th of
July, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Creditspring](https://www.creditspring.co.uk) in [their offices][cs-venue], on 75 Davies Street. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#july23registration).

## Agenda

### Ruby to solve homelessness and the refugee crises

[Dan Hough](http://beam.org/) says:

> Social impact startup Beam (named by LinkedIn as one of the UKâ€™s Top 15
> Startups) has built pioneering products for government, social care workers -
> and homeless people and refugees themselves. Together, Beam is proving that
> tech can solve these problems for good. Hear about how a small Engineering
> team has built software that has transformed the lives of thousands of
> homeless people and refugees. And hear about the fun, meaning and challenge in
> Tech for Good.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#july23registration}

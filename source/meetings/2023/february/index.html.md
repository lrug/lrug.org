The February 2022 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of
February, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

**ðŸ‘ª in person meeting alert ðŸ‘ª**

Maybe next month we'll stop calling this out as a novelty, but for now
it's still potentially unusual so here we are. We're once again
in-person and the
lovely folk at [Funding Circle](https://fundingcircle.com) are hosting us
in [their offices][fc-venue], on Queen Victoria St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#feb23registration).

## Agenda

### A Supposedly Fun Thing Iâ€™ll Never Stream Again: live coding a Ruby project

[Tom Stuart](https://tomstu.art/) says:

> Last September I began regularly livestreaming my work on a side project to build a WebAssembly interpreter in Ruby. In this talk Iâ€™ll tell you how itâ€™s going and what Iâ€™ve learned so far.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#feb23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all

The November 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of
November, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/)
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#nov23registration).

## Agenda

### Outside Technology: Building bridges between engineers and everyone else

[Naomi Christie](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/naomichristie) says:

> Naomi will take you on a journey from her previous career outside
> technology to her current career as a software engineer highlighting some
> of the (many) things she had to learn along the way, providing insight into
> why misunderstandings are common between engineers and their stakeholders
> and offering some ideas on how we can bridge that gap.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#nov23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our

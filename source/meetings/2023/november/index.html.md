The November 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of
November, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [Zappi](https://www.zappi.io/web/)
in [their offices][zappi-venue], on  Camden High St. [Full venue and
registration details are given below](#nov23registration).

## Agenda

### Outside Technology: Building bridges between engineers and everyone else

[Naomi Christie](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/naomichristie) says:

> Naomi will take you on a journey from her previous career outside
> technology to her current career as a software engineer highlighting some
> of the (many) things she had to learn along the way, providing insight into
> why misunderstandings are common between engineers and their stakeholders
> and offering some ideas on how we can bridge that gap.

### The Art of Talk Design

[Melinda Seckington](https://www.seckington.com/) says:

> Everywhere you look, stories surround us, and everyone has something that’s worth sharing with others. As speakers, we need to understand how to structure our talks so they can have the best effect on the audiences we are trying to reach. How do you discover the right angle and the right story for a talk? How do you frame your story?
>
> Within tech we know how to approach building a new product: we research our user base, we figure out what and for who we’re trying to create something for and we make sure we constantly iterate on what we’ve come up with. So why aren’t we taking the same approach for our talks?
>
> This talk will examine how to get in the right mindset of examining your talk ideas, and will introduce a framework of how to design and iterate on your talk. It will focus on several exercises and questions to help you create the best talk for the story you’re trying to tell.

## Afterwards

When the talks come to an end we'll decamp to a local pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

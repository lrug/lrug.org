The August 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 14th of
August, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [beam](https://beam.org/) in [their offices](#beam-venue), at the Senna Building WeWork in Shoreditch. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#august23registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#august23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all
attendees.

### Secure your place

Hopefully you all remember that physical meetings involve finite space and so to be guaranteed entry **[you need to register via eventbrite][august-2023-eventbrite]**.

The venue has a hard limit of 80 people.  If you register and realise you

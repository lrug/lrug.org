The August 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 14th of
August, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the lovely folk at [beam](https://beam.org/) in [their offices](#beam-venue), at the Senna Building WeWork in Shoreditch. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#august23registration).

## Agenda

### BorrowMyDoggy - Connecting dogs and people via Ruby

[Rikke Rosenlund](https://www.borrowmydoggy.com/) says

> BorrowMyDoggy connects dog owners with local borrowers
for walks, weekends and holidays. Via BorrowMyDoggy, borrowers get happy
dog time, owners get help with taking care of their dogs, and dogs get more
love and attention (it's a win-win scenario). We started by winning the
Lean Startup Machine, then received a crazy amount of media attention and
by now have built a community of +1 million members in the UK and Ireland,
and are working with some of the biggest players in the pet space. Come and
listen to how a simple idea has now turned into a well known brand.

### Gain insight and better accessibility into your application's data by using The Brick

[Lorin Thwaits](https://www.facebook.com/lorint/) says

> Remarkable visibility into the structure of your application and its data
is available by using the open-source Rails gem "[The Brick](
https://github.com/lorint/brick)". Come meet the author of this gem, and
experience the cornucopia of usefulness it can provide to teams who
architect, elaborate upon, and then support Rails applications.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub to visit so we can eat, drink, and
discuss the talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#august23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our

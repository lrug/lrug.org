The March 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of
March, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the
lovely folk at [Zinc](https://zinc.vc) at their offices, on Eversholt Street. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#mar23registration).

## Agenda

<%= render_talks %>

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#mar23registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of

The March 2023 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of
March, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This month we're hosted by the
lovely folk at [Zinc](https://zinc.vc) at their offices, on Eversholt Street. [Full venue and registration details are given below](#mar23registration).

## Agenda

###  Native apps are dead, long live native apps: Using Turbo Native to make hybrid apps that don’t suck.

[Ayush](https://ruby.social/@ayush) says:

> You’ve heard it hundreds of times: Hybrid apps suck. That may have been true in the past, but things have changed significantly in the last decade. With tools like Turbo Native working in conjunction with Ruby on Rails, it’s possible to mix web technologies with native APIs to build slick hybrid mobile apps. We’ll take a look at why the hybrid approach gets such a bad rap, why that reputation is undeserved, and how we can build hybrid apps that don't suck.

### End to End typing for web applications

[Frederick Cheung](https://ruby.social/@fglc2) says:

> Ever had a bug because the frontend made incorrect assumptions about the shape of response data from the backend? Or maybe you trod nervously during a refactor? Or perhaps you broke an app by changing the backend data in a way you didn’t think would matter?

> Learn how avoid this type of mistake, enabling you to keep moving fast, by having a single source of truth for your data types, checked both on the frontend and the backend.

## Afterwards

Once we're done with the talks we'll leave the venue (after doing our best
to help tidy up) and find a local pub for to eat, drink, and discuss the
talks we've just heard.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

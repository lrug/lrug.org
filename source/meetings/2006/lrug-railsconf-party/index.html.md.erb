With the generous help of [Skillsmatter](http://skillsmatter.com), we've arranged a party for Thursday 14th September, to tie in with RailsConf.  It's at a bar called Sequoia @ Ruby Lo, at 23 Orchard Street W1 [[Map]](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Orchard+Street,+Westminster,+Greater+London,+W1&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=51.515072,-0.154281&spn=0.018721,0.042958&om=1&iwloc=A) (near Selfridges, nearest tube: Bond Street).

It all starts at 9pm and the first 100 drinks are free (courtesy of [Skillsmatter](http://skillsmatter.com)), so whether you're attending the conference or not, come down and join us.  Free entry before 10pm, &pound;5 after.

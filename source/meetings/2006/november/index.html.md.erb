Our next meeting will be on Monday November 13, 6:30-8pm. We've got two great speakers lined up.

## Agenda

### Ten Things I Hate About Rails

[Paul Battley](http://po-ru.com/) will be sharing _Ten things I hate about Rails_ - insights he's gained from poking into Ruby on Rails' soft underbelly. He'll also present brief highlights from [Euruko 2006](http://euruko.com/), the European Ruby Conference.

Slides and more information about the talk are [available on Paul's blog](http://po-ru.com/diary/ten-things-i-hate-about-rails/).

### Bad Things With Capistrano

Tom Ward will encourage us to _Do Bad Things with Capistrano_, telling us what [Capistrano](http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17) is, what it does and how its usefulness is limited in no way to deployment of Rails apps.  He'll also show a couple of the very bad things he's done with it.

### Misc.

We'll kick off with a quick review of activity of interest to the Ruby community - including brief impressions from [Rob McKinnon's](http://blog.theyworkforyou.co.nz/) first virtual attendence at a [Rubyists of Second Life Meeting](http://secondlife.com/events/event.php?id=311956&date=1161219600).

The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 12th of May, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm, our usual [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) venue at [1 Sekforde St.](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=EC1R+0BE&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&om=1&iwloc=addr).  However, depending on numbers (see the note about <a href="#may08registration">registration</a> below) we might move to a larger venue.

## Agenda

### Settling New Caprica: getting your pet project off the ground.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/snowblink/2490612702/" title="Lessons Learned (20080512-R0010896.jpg) by snowblink, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2275/2490612702_2b285ba70f_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Lessons Learned (20080512-R0010896.jpg)" /></a>

[Tom Armitage](http://infovore.org/) launched a rails forum site called [New Caprica](http://new-caprica.org/) back in March after ~9 months of toil.  In his own words:

> On the way it's had two rewrites, I've taught myself [Test:Unit](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html), [RSpec](http://rspec.info/),
> [Capistrano](http://capify.org/), and a few other things through it, and it currently has
> about [74% C0 coverage](http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov) and a 2:1 Test:Code ratio.
>
> I'm also pretty exhausted, and now have the joy of wrangling real users.
> 
> Anyhow, I thought there could be something fun in lessons learned, a few
> bits of advice I realised on the way, and perhaps a small demo of the
> software.

### Monkeyweaving: Live Native Monkeypatching

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/snowblink/2490608134/" title="Tim Becker (20080512-R0010881.jpg) by snowblink, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3270/2490608134_e56cbaee24_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Tim Becker (20080512-R0010881.jpg)" /></a>

[Tim Becker](http://blog.kuriositaet.de) popped up on our [mailing list](/mailing-list) to offer up a talk about a new meta-programming library called [weave](http://weave.rubyforge.org/) that he'd been developing.  In his own words:

> weave is a library for 'live native monkey patching'. It provides a
> native wrapper to the C functions in the MRI Ruby implementation that
> are involved in creating native extensions. This allows you to swap
> native code in and out at runtime.

## Pub

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/snowblink/2490614568/" title="Pub! (20080512-R0010897.jpg) by snowblink, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2225/2490614568_1ace529bd7_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Pub! (20080512-R0010897.jpg)" /></a>

It's LRUG tradition to follow up the formal part of the night with a drink or two at [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html).  It's an excellent opportunity to find out what the rest of the ruby community is up to, and find people to help you out with your own pet projects.  If you don't think you'll make it for the talks we're usually in the pub from about 8:00pm, so come along and don't miss out on the fun.

Registration <a name="may08registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

[Please register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/london-ruby-user-group-may-meeting) if you are planning to come.  Registration allows SKills Matter to organise a larger room if we need it.  For the past couple of meetings we've used the overflow venue, but prior to that we've had to close registration and turn people away.  The larger room, close to the usual venue, needs about a weeks notice for Skills Matter to book it.  Please, therefore, [register now](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/london-ruby-user-group-may-meeting) rather than later.  

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/500589/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

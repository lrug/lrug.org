The August 2008 meeting of LRUG will be held on Monday 11th September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Please register [here](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/167-lrug-meeting-august).  It will be held as [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/).

## Agenda

### Ruby / Watir

[Aidy Lewis](http://agiletester.blogspot.com/) will give a talk on a Ruby Watir framework that object models your AUT and uses Rspec Story Runner.

### Sphinx

[Pat Allan](http://freelancing-gods.com/) was scheduled to talk to us about [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com/) but will be unable to attend.  Sorry!

## Pub

The talks generally are all done and dusted by 8pm, at which point we decamp to the local pub, [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html) for a spot of socialising.  If you can't make the talks for whatever reason, you're always welcome to turn up just for the post-mortem in the pub.

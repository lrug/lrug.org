The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 14th of July, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  It's very likely it will held be in the [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/) overflow venue at [The Old Sessions House](http://www.sessionshouse.com/) on [Clerkenwell Green](http://tinyurl.com/2bjjzz).  Please do <a href="#registration">register your attendance</a> early (see the note about <a href="#jul08registration">registration</a> below).

## Agenda

Note: Expect more info on each of these talks as we get closer to the actual date of the meeting.

### <strike>Starling + Memcached</strike>

* James has had to pull out due to a double booking.  Stay tuned for a replacement.*

[James Cox](http://imaj.es/) says this about his talk:

> As part of my anti-hermitization, I'll be swinging by LRUG for possibly the first time to 
> show off [starling](http://rubyforge.org/projects/starling/) and why it's cool. Starling was a
> project born from trying to manage message queues using [memcached](http://www.danga.com/memcached/). 
> I'll try and explain how it came about, show how it works and figure out some ways it could be 
> used productively.

### RabbitMQ + Ruby

Ben Hood kindly offered to step in and talk about some work he's been doing with [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) and ruby.  The outline is:

* Characterize the motivations behind messaging in Ruby applications;
* Touch on the current approaches that have been taken;
* Look at what AMQP offers in general;
* Discuss how this potential can be harnessed in a Rubyesque fashion;
* Elaborate using real example on what has been developed to date and what is currently being worked on.

A video of Ben's talk, filmed by [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/rabbitmq-and-ruby) is available on [Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1834210641779857494&hl=en).
 
### Acts As Xapian

[Francis Irving](http://flourish.org/):

> I'd like to give a talk about my new Rails search engine plugin,
> which is called [acts_as_xapian](http://github.com/frabcus/acts_as_xapian/)

Francis will probably also cover some of the site's he's been using xapian on, such as [WhatDoTheyKnow](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/).

A video of Francis's talk, filmed by [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/act-as-xapian) is available on [Google Video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6233140832834795067&hl=en).

## Pub

The talks generally are all done and dusted by 8pm, at which point we decamp to the local pub, [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html) for a spot of socialising.  If you can't make the talks for whatever reason, you're always welcome to turn up just for the post-mortem in the pub.

## Registration {#jul08registration}

[Please register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/rabbitmq-ruby) if you are planning to come.  Registration allows Skills Matter to organise a larger room if we need it.  For the past few meetings we've used their overflow venue and thus avoided having to turn people away because of fire-regulations.  We hope to do so again so please [register now](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/rabbitmq-ruby) rather than later (Skills Matter need about a weeks notice to book the larger room).  

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/814071/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

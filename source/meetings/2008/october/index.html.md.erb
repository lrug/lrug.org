The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 13th of October, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will choose the most appropriate venue based on the number of <a href="#oct08registration">registrations</a>.  Going on past meetings it'll be either in [Skills Matter's offices](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=skillsmatter+ec1r+0be&ie=UTF8&cid=51524602,-104662,10325109927309711932&s=AARTsJrMIyRGqi5u5rwj683gPacEM_GIrA&ll=51.523297,-0.107889&spn=0.010601,0.018668&z=16&iwloc=A) or their overflow venue [The Old Sessions House](http://www.sessionshouse.com/) on [Clerkenwell Green](http://tinyurl.com/2bjjzz).  Please do <a href="#oct08registration">register your attendance</a> early to help them choose the right venue.

## Agenda

### Event Stream and LRUG Quiz

[Steve Ganly](http://concept-shop.com/) will first talk about developing EventStream - a technique to
record and playback non-idempotent requests on a web site. Initially a
developers tool it also gives some interesting possibilities when used
in production too.

Steve will then host the LRUG pub quiz, covering the specialist topics
of Ruby, Rails and a whole cartload of stuff for geeks to chuckle over.

## Pub

After the talks we head on over to a local pub, [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html), for a thorough debriefing session.  The pub is open to all, so if you can't make the talks for whatever reason, come on down to the pub and get them in early (mine's a Franziskaner, cheers!).

## Registration {#oct08registration}

[Please register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-meeting-october) if you are planning to come.  Registration allows Skills Matter to organise the most appropriate room for the number of people coming.  In the past we've had to turn people away who didn't register because the room was full and there was no room for extra bodies.  We don't like having to do that, so please [register now](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-meeting-october) rather than later (Skills Matter need about a weeks notice to book the larger room) and secure your place.  

There's also an [upcoming event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1161266/) for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.

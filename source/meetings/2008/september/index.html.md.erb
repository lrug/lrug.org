The September 2008 meeting of LRUG will be held on Monday 8th September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Please register [here](http://skillsmatter.com/event/home/lrug-meeting-top-ten-most-horrendous-ruby-hacks-rlisp-lisp-inside-ruby).  It will either be at [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com/), or their overflow venue at [The Old Sessions House](http://www.sessionshouse.com/) on [Clerkenwell Green](http://tinyurl.com/2bjjzz), depending on the number of registrations.

## Agenda

### Top Ten Most Horrendous Ruby Hacks

[Daniel Lucraft](www.daniellucraft.com/blog) will be going through 10 horrendous ruby hacks, taken from code written by both himself and others.  While he already has a number of horrible pieces of code, there's always room for more, so don't be shy, send your examples to him (dan at fluentradical dot com) and you may make the top ten!

### RLisp - Lisp inside Ruby

[Tomasz Wegrzanowski](http://t-a-w.blogspot.com/) will be presenting a talk on his project [RLisp](http://chaosforge.org/taw/rlisp/), a Lisp dialect naturally embedded in Ruby

## Pub

The talks generally are all done and dusted by 8pm, at which point we decamp to the local pub, [The Crown Tavern](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html) for a spot of socialising.  If you can't make the talks for whatever reason, you're always welcome to turn up just for the post-mortem in the pub.

### Background processing in Ruby (and Rails)

[Khash Sajadi](http://sajadi.co.uk/dflat/) says:

> This is an introduction to scalable background processing in Ruby
> (and Rails) applications. It discusses best practises on task
> management, managing and scaling long running processes in apps
> and overviews different solutions from high end of [Delayed Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job)
> to more detailed ones like [Event Machine](http://rubyeventmachine.com/).

## Pub

The talks will finish around 8pm, but that doesn't mean you have to go home.  Oh no!  Us LRUG folks are a friendly lot, and so we continue the evening over at [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) which is a short walk from the Skills Matter office.  Do join us there if you can't make the formal talks.

## Registration {#nov12registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-november-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-november-meetup).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-november/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

The July 2012 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 9th of July, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#jul12registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Happier deployments through gradual feature rollout

[Sam Phillips](http://samsworldofno.com/) is going to tell us all about feature switching:

> Releasing a big change to an application, whether a large overhaul of
> the UX, system migration or upgrade to the internals, can be daunting.
> Will the change work technically? Will it make your users happy and
> improve the desired metrics? This talk discusses strategies and
> technologies you can use to gradually roll changes out to gather early
> feedback and prove your assumptions. It includes in-depth looks at
> some technologies available (including the [rollout](https://github.com/jamesgolick/rollout) gem), as well as the
> part that gradual feature rollout has to play within your agile
> process.
>
> These are all true stories, most of which I've been involved in. I'll
> cover experiences of products and projects of varying sizes, talk
> about different solutions for different environments and, just to be
> fair, I include the humiliating (character-building) mistakes I've
> made along the way.

### What Ruby can't do

[J. Pablo FernÃ¡dez](http://pupeno.com/) is going to show us what ruby *can't* do:

> Ruby is an amazing language, it has an beautiful object model, a
> concise syntax and it allows you to write functional code
> elegantly. It's probably one of the most powerful programming
> languages out there, yet, there are still some things it cannot
> do. Let's explore those aspects because it'll open our minds to
> think differently but most important, because it's fun!

## Pub

The speaker-based part of the meeting finishes at 8pm, but that's not when LRUG finishes.  No!  We head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) for the chat-based part of the meeting.  Attendance at the first part of the meeting is not required if you just fancy a pint with some ruby geeks.

## Registration {#jul12registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you must [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/happier-deploments/js-4501).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/happier-deploments/js-4501).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-july/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

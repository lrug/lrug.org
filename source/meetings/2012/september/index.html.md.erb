The September 2012 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 10th of September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#sep12registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Doing less and keeping it simple

[Ian Kynnersley](http://iankynnersley.co.uk/) describes his talk as follows:

> What do we mean when we talk about simplicity? Why is it important and why is
> it so hard to achieve?

He wrote a little about this topic a couple of months ago on [his company blog](http://sidekickstudios.net/blog/2012/06/simples).

### Objective C for Rubyists

[Chris O'Sullivan](http://www.thechrisoshow.com/) is going to give us 15 minutes on Objective-C:

> There are so many things we take for granted writing Ruby code -
> initialising hashes and arrays, doing basic arithmetic with floats and
> integers, using subscript accessors for containers.  Trying to do
> these basic things in Objective C requires writing screeds of
> boilerplate code.
>
> Well, it's time to have another look at Objective C.
>
> The latest version of the compiler includes some wonderful shortcuts
> to make your code more concise, readable, and a lot more like Ruby. In
> this talk I'll give you a whirlwind tour of these changes.

### Zero-Downtime Deployment

[Jairo Diaz](http://www.codescrum.com/) says:

> A zero-downtime deployment configuration is important for
> critical systems that need to handle every request (i.e.
> financial system) and lately for systems following
> continuous delivery  principles since there could be many
> frequent deployments .  This talks present a simple
> configuration for zero-downtime deployments for ruby
> applications.

## Pub

Our talks finish around 8pm, but that's not the end of the evening.  We carry on at [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) which is a short walk from the Skills Matter office.  There's usually lots of conversations going on after the talks, so if you can't make the talks please do feel free to pop along for a drink at the pub.

Also, the nice folks at [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/) are sponsoring some drinks behind the bar again, so it's an even better idea to come along than usual.

## Registration {#sep12registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ruby-rails/lrug-september-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ruby-rails/lrug-september-meetup).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-september/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

The February 2012 meeting of LRUG will be on *Tuesday* the 21st of February, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#feb12registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

As is now traditional, we devote our February meeting to lightning talks.  Not just any old lightning talks either, we use the 20x20 format for the talks.  Each speaker has 20 slides that auto-transition after 20 seconds, giving them a total of 6 minutes and 40 seconds in which to get their point across.

Our confirmed volunteers for 2012 are:

### A history of websockets

This is not the running order, on the night we randomise the order of the speakers *for even more fun*!

## Pub

With all these talks on the night, you're bound to want to chat to at least one of the speakers afterwards.  Have no fear! We do that in [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/), which is only five minutes from Skills Matter's offices.  We'll be there from about 8pm, so if you can't make the talks come along just for the pub bit.

## Registration {#feb12registration}

Skills Matter ask that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-lightning-talks-2012/js-3484) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's usually plenty of space for everyone so it's not a huge problem if you don't register, we'll still be allowed in.  However, it does help with arranging the room to make sure there are enough seats laid out, and it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-lightning-talks-2012/js-3484).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-february/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

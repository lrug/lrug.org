The May 2012 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 14th of May, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#may12registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

## Agenda

### Ruby's bin men: a closer look at the garbage collector

[Elise Huard](http://jabberwocky.eu/) is going to give us a version of the talk she has proposed for [EuRuKo 2012](http://www.euruko2012.org/):

> The Garbage Collector: how does it work?
> What does it mean when people speak about stop-the-world,
> mark-and-sweep, generational garbage collectors?
> How does ruby fare at collecting its own garbage?
> What does it mean when they say 1.9.3's garbage collector has improved?
> This talk will explain those concepts, what the impact of garbage
> collection is on our programs, and what future could be.

This description is taken from her [pull request on EuRuKo's github-based cfp](https://github.com/euruko2012/call-for-proposals/pull/73).  If you like her talk, or have any comments, feel free to get involved over there to let the EuRuKo organisers know that they should select it.

### Dependency Injection, the Dependency Inversion Principle, and You

[Tom Stuart](http://tomstuart.co.uk/) is also going to give us a version of his EuRuKo proposal:

> It's received wisdom that Ruby doesn't need dependency injection
> frameworks. In this talk, I'll claim that this is at least in
> part because we don't apply the [Dependency Inversion Principle](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf)
> properly. I'll explore the intent of the principle, its benefits
> for maintainable and testable code, and show how to improve
> existing code through its application.
>
> I'll then go on to explore how to create objects with dependencies
> wired in, hoping to settle the question of whether we need a framework to do this.

Tom's talk is also available for discussion on the [EuRuKo gothub-based CFP](https://github.com/euruko2012/call-for-proposals/pull/72).  Comments, notes, etc.. should go there if you have them.

## Pub

After the talks we continue the evening in [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  If you can't make the talks, we're usually in the pub by 8pm, so you should come and join us.

## Registration {#may12registration}

To secure a place at the meeting you must [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-may-1376/js-4073).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-may-1376/js-4073).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-may/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

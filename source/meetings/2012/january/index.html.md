The January 2012 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 9th of January, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#jan12registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Chris McGrath: I18n

[Chris McGrath](https://twitter.com/chrismcg) says:

> The talk is about lessons learned localising a rails app into nine
> different languages. It will cover:
>
> * Why we localised our app
> * Why you might want to use rails i18n even if you're only planning one language
> * A little bit about how the i18n gem works for those unfamiliar with it
> * Common problems you'll have and ways to work around them
>
> The app we localised is [http://www.kyero.com](http://www.kyero.com/) and the
> tool we've built to help us and other ruby / rails devs using the i18n gem
> in [http://localeapp.com](http://localeapp.com/).

### Joe Corcoran: Judge

[Joe Corcoran](http://blog.joecorcoran.co.uk/) says:

> I'll talk about building [Judge](https://github.com/joecorcoran/judge), a client side form validation gem for
> Rails 3.  I'll explain how I've tried to keep it lightweight and
> unassuming, why I ditched jQuery in favour of plain old JavaScript and
> what I learned about Rails i18n, form builders and HTML data
> attributes along the way.  I'll also give a brief introduction to
> [Travis](http://travis-ci.org/), the distributed build system that I've been using for
> continuous integration.

## Pub

The night doesn't end at 8pm after the talks though.  Oh No!.  We're a fun-lovin' gang so we head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to have a few drinks and continue the ruby chatter well into the night.  If you can't make the talks you really should come along for the pub.

---------------------------------------------------

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-january-2012) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-january-2012).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-january/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

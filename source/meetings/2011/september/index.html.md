The September 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 12th of September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#sep11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

Agenda
------

### Stories from the e-petitions front-line

Some of the team ([Chris Parsons](http://chrismdp.github.com/), [Jolyon Pawlyn](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/jolyon-pawlyn)) behind the newly launched [government e-petitions website](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) will talk to us about the issues they had with scaling the site, how they solved them, and how they continue to monitor and improve the service:

> A talk about caching, chef, munin, load testing and hosting. As part of its adoption of agile
> techniques and its creation of a Skunkworks division, [DirectGov](http://direct.gov.uk) asked the [Agile Delivery Network](http://www.agiledelivery.net/)
> to build a successor website to the Number 10 e-petitions site with a 6 week deadline. The talk
> aims to highlight the measures taken to cope with high throughput, what worked and what could be
> done differently to avoid headlines like ["Government's e-petition website crashes on first day"](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/aug/04/government-e-petition-website-crashes).

Registration <a name="sep11registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/ruby-september) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/ruby-september).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-september/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

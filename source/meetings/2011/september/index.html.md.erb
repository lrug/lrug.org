The September 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 12th of September, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#sep11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Stories from the e-petitions front-line

Some of the team ([Chris Parsons](http://chrismdp.github.com/), [Jolyon Pawlyn](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/jolyon-pawlyn)) behind the newly launched [government e-petitions website](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) will talk to us about the issues they had with scaling the site, how they solved them, and how they continue to monitor and improve the service:

> A talk about caching, chef, munin, load testing and hosting. As part of its adoption of agile
> techniques and its creation of a Skunkworks division, [DirectGov](http://direct.gov.uk) asked the [Agile Delivery Network](http://www.agiledelivery.net/)
> to build a successor website to the Number 10 e-petitions site with a 6 week deadline. The talk
> aims to highlight the measures taken to cope with high throughput, what worked and what could be
> done differently to avoid headlines like ["Government's e-petition website crashes on first day"](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/aug/04/government-e-petition-website-crashes).

### Something else

If you're interested in filling this slot, [find out what it means](/speaking) and then [get in touch](/mailing-list).

## Pub

The talks should finish by 8pm and after this we continue the evening in [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/), a short walk from the talk venue.  If you're not interested in the talks, or can't make them for some reason, please do turn up to the pub.  The more the merrier!

## Registration {#sep11registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/ruby-september) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/ruby-september).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-september/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

The October 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 10th of October, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#oct11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Battleship: Ruby Fight Club

[Paul Battley](http://po-ru.com/) has written [a game engine based on the game of battleships](https://github.com/threedaymonk/battleship) and will be letting us play with it.  *Before the meeting* you should write a player for Paul's game engine and during the meeting we'll pit the players against each other in a tournament.  Once the winner is declared we'll look at the player implementations and get their authors to talk about them.  In case you win you should be prepared to show off your code and discuss the strategy you implemented.

There is more information available on the [mailing list thread where Paul announced the event](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2011-September/006352.html).  If you have any questions [the mailing list](/mailing-list) is the place to ask them.

_UPDATE_ 
If you have written a player [read this missive from Paul](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2011-October/006510.html) and make sure you are prepared.

## Pub

We should be done sinking each other's battleships by 8pm.  Those still on speaking terms will make the short trip to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/), to tell tall tales of maritime success and failure.  If you can't make the battle royale that is the main meeting, feel free to turn up to the pub.

## Registration {#sep11registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/lrug-battleship/js-2718) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/lrug-battleship/js-2718).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-october/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

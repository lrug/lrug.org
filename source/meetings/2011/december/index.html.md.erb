The December 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 12th of December, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#dec11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

If you use, write, or maintain APIs for your web applications, you'll love our line-up this month; December is API month!

### Mark Burns: HATEOAS

[Mark Burns](http://twitter.com/_mark_burns) says:

> I've been trying to understand the [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) constraint myself. 
> [Roy Fielding's blog posts](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/tag/rest) are almost indecipherable to an 
> ordinary developer like me. I think there's a huge gap in relevant easily accessible information on 
> understanding it, and how to implement it, what it's benefits are etc.
>
> One of the aspects that I've found particularly confusing is the concept of not having out-of-band 
> communication and having discoverable APIs. 
>
> In [one particular blog post](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven) Roy says:
>
>> A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of 
>> standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be 
>> understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state 
>> transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in 
>> the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. 
>> The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and 
>> resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand).
>> [Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]
>
> I'd like to talk about how this limitation on out-of-band information seems both insane and 
> impractical, maybe impossible. But then I may go on to explore how actually it makes some 
> form of sense. And how you can use this knowledge to write APIs that are easier to code to, 
> and whilst not resilient to change in some magical sense, it should allow you to write clients
> that are easier to adapt and update.

### Javier Ramirez: Usable APIs

[Javier Ramirez](http://twitter.com/supercoco9) says:

> With the adoption of REST, the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, and the second coming 
> of JavaScript, exposing our applications as a service is now more important than ever.
>
> Rails or Sinatra make really easy to create a (kinda) RESTful API but, in many occassions, 
> these APIs are designed without really thinking on the developers that will have to use them.
>
> I want to talk about some of the points that can help making your API more developer-friendly. 
> Some of the areas I'll cover will be discoverability, authentication, headers, formats, parameters, 
> documentation and tools.

## Pub

We usually finish the talks at around 8pm and head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to chat about the talks, or whatever comes to mind, over a beer and a fish-finger sandwich.  Sometimes you can't make it to the main event, that's not a problem though, just come along to the pub and you'll be welcomed with open arms.  Especially if you get there a bit before 8pm and secure me a table.

## Registration {#dec11registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/ruby-apis/js-3123) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/ruby-apis/js-3123).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-december/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

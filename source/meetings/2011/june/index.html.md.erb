The June 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 13th of June, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#jun11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Here's My Gem

The plan for this month's meeting is to have several local rubyists talk about gems that they have written.  To let them give their gem a wider audience, and to show off that the LRUG community is a prolific bunch.  Confirmed so far:

#### [Paul Battley](http://po-ru.com/)

> [htmlentities](http://rubygems.org/gems/htmlentities) - HTMLEntities is a simple library to facilitate encoding and decoding of named or numerical entities in HTML and XHTML documents.

#### [Ismael Celis](http://home.ismaelcelis.com/)

> [hash_mapper](http://rubygems.org/gems/hash_mapper), [jbundle](http://rubygems.org/gems/jbundle), or [anisoptera](https://github.com/ismasan/anisoptera)

{::coverage year="2011" month="june" talk="hash-mapper-jbundle-or-anisoptera" /}

#### [Paul Fedory](http://paulfedory.com/)

> [RolePlay](http://rubygems.org/gems/role_play) - RolePlay is a simple gem that provides roles for ActiveRecord objects (typically a user model, giving them the role of administrator or moderator.  As well as covering RolePlay, Paul will also cover tips for upgrading gems to have Rails 3 compatibility.

#### [Phil Nash](http://twitter.com/philnash)

> [Asset Hat](http://rubygems.org/gems/asset_hat) - Asset Hat deals with asset optimisation once Rails has done it's job, getting your assets from your server to your user faster.

#### [Matthew Sadler](http://sourcetagsandcodes.com/)

> [http_tools](http://rubygems.org/gems/http_tools) - A fast-as-possible pure Ruby HTTP parser plus associated lower level utilities to aid working with HTTP and the web.

> [Matahari](http://rubygems.org/gems/matahari) - A test-spy library, inspired by Mockito and RR

## Pub

As is usual we'll decamp from Skills Matter's offices to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) for a drink or two after the talks.  It's only a short walk away so we'll be there from about 8pm onwards.  If you can't make the main meeting then feel free to pitch up just for the pub-bit.  There's usually some rubyists there until closing time, so you're bound to find someone to talk to no matter what time you make it over.

## Registration {#jun11registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/expert-profile/ajax-ria/various-speakers) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/expert-profile/ajax-ria/various-speakers).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-june/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

The November 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 14th of November, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#nov11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Transformers: Code Blocks In Disguise

[Aanand](http://aanandprasad.com/) has some Ruby code to show you. It looks a little strange - in fact, it doesn't even look valid.

    Array.run do
      x <- ["first", "second"]
      y <- ["once", "twice"]

      ["#{x} cousin #{y} removed"]
    end

What does it do, and how does it do it? If you know what a macro is, or a continuation, or a monad, you might be able to guess. If not, don't worry - by the end, you'll probably be as confused as everyone else, including the speaker.

### My Adventures in Objective-C

[Abdel](http://twitter.com/abdels) wants to tell us about his experiences of developing an iOS app from a Rubyists perspective:

> I have been ducking Objective-C at every turn for a very long time. Who wants to learn a heavily typed static behemoth just to write an iPhone app?!
>
> So, I did what every self respecting programmer would do, throw alternative open solutions aka Javascript frameworks at the problem.
>
> But in the end I had to succumb to the will of the Almighty Apple - I needed their Objective C to make stuff happen ... and it wasn't that bad :)
>
> This is all the learning, similarities (of which there are a few) and differences between Objective-C and Ruby.

## Pub

We aim to finish up around about 8pm, but that's not the end of the evening.  After the talks we head on over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) for some light refreshment and informal chat.  If you can't make the first part of the meeting, please do feel free to turn up to this second part.

## Registration {#nov11registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/november-lrug/js-2838) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/november-lrug/js-2838).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-november/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

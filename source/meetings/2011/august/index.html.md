The August 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 8th of August, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#aug11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

Agenda
------

### Managing Web Application Servers with Puppet

[Paul Mucur](http://mudge.name) describes his talk as follows:

> Joshua Sierles of 37signals once described configuration management as
> something that ["doesn't sound sexy, but it's the single most important
> thing we do as sysadmins"](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1872-nuts-bolts-configuration-management-with-chef)
> but what is it and what do tools like
> Chef and Puppet offer from the point of view of a developer?
>
> In this presentation I want to talk about how configuration management
> allowed me -- a developer with no access to the live servers and
> working with system administrators in a different time zone -- to not
> only install and configure servers quickly and in a repeatable way but
> also let me be confident about the consistency of each and every
> machine I deploy to.
> 
> Using the example of getting a server ready to run a Rails application
> using [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/) (and testing things out with the aid of [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)), I will
> showcase some patterns that we have developed for managing versions of
> Ruby with RVM, the installation of Phusion Passenger and how to deploy
> a database.yml when you're not allowed to see live passwords.

### Chef and Vagrant

[Gareth Rushgrove](http://morethanseven.net/) is a sometimes Ruby programmer and occasional sysadmin. He curates the [devopsweekly mailing list](http://devopsweekly.com/), lives in Cambridge and writes code for fun and profit.

> Most developers spend far too much time managing a development
> environment that is different to the one they use for production
> applications. Different tools, different underlying libraries and
> different bugs. Local virtualisation provides an answer, but
> historically it's been time consuming and annoying to setup and
> manage. Using configuration management tools like [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) to set things
> up, and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) to easily manage the virtual machines
> from the command line provides modern developers the best of all
> possible worlds.

### <strike>Cucumber-chef</strike>

<strike>
[Stephen Nelson-Smith](http://agilesysadmin.net) is the author of ["Test-driven infrastructure with Chef" (published by O'Reilly)](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920020042) and is going to talk to us about [cucumber-chef](http://www.cucumber-chef.org/):

> [Cucumber-chef](https://github.com/Atalanta/cucumber-chef) is a library of tools to enable the 
> emerging discipline of infrastructure as code to practice test driven development. It provides a 
> testing platform within which [cucumber](http://cukes.info/) tests can be run which provision 
> lightweight virtual machines, configure them by applying the appropriate [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/)
> roles to them, and then run acceptance and integration tests against the environment.
</strike>

Stephen had to pull out, we'll try to reschedule him for our September meeting.

Pub
---

We aim to finish up the talk part of the evening by 8pm.  At this point we talk a short walk to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to round off the evening with wine and song.  If you're unable to attend the talks, you're more than welcome to turn up at the pub whenever you can.

Registration
------------

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/lrug-puppet/js-2293) if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/lrug-puppet/js-2293).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-august/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

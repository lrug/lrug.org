The May 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 9th of May, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#may11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

## Agenda

### Andrew McDonough : Ruby Golf

[Andrew McDonough](http://www.andrewmcdonough.com/) is going to lead a practical evening called "Ruby Golf".  He describes it as follows:

> I started my career as a perl programmer.  Perl, like
> ruby has a lot of 'syntactic sugar' to help developers write concise
> code.  Perl programmers sometimes play a game known as '[Perl Golf](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PerlGolf)' to
> explore the lesser-known features of the language.  The aim of 'perl
> golf' is to solve a problem using the fewest characters possible.
>
> At this month's meeting Andrew will run a practical evening based
> around 'ruby golf', an adaptation of perl golf for ruby developers.
> People will be asked to form teams of 4-8 people, and solve nine short
> ruby golf 'holes' using as few characters as possible.  Each hole will
> be defined by a set of [RSpec](http://rspec.info) examples describing a single method, and
> the teams must write the method to pass all of the examples.  At the
> end, the solutions will be scored and the winning team will be
> announced.
>
> This evening should have something for everyone; beginners can pick up
> some language tricks and learn how to write code to pass tests, while
> experienced ruby developers will have the opportunity to show off
> their skills and compete with their peers.

Note: This is going to be a full evening of practical activity.  We'll break up into small groups on the night to go through what Andrew has prepared.  You should bring your laptop so you can play along.  Don't worry if you don't know anyone, there will be plenty of groups to join in on the night.  Also, you should sign up to the [mailing list](/mailing-list) to find out about any further instructions.

## Pub

After all this golfing we'll make the short trip to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) for our 19th hole.  We normally finish up the meetings at around 8pm, and are in the bar by 8:05pm.  If you can't make the main meeting (but you really should try, it'll be a great way to flex your ruby muscles and learn about short-cuts you never knew existed) don't feel like you can't come along just for the pub part; you'd be more than welcome.

## Registration {#may11registration}

Skills Matter prefer that you [register your attendance with them](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/ruby-golf/js-1714) if you are coming to the meeting.  On a few exceptional occasions we've had to turn away people who haven't registered, but this has only been at extremely popular meetings, and has yet to happen at the new venue on Goswell Road.  It's better to be safe than sorry though, and it is polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/ruby-golf/js-1714).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-may/), but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?

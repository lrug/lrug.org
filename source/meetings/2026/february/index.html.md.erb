## Agenda

## Afterwards

Once all that is over, we will have plenty to talk about so we'll head on
out to a nearby pub for some food, some
drinks and some chat with your fellow attendees.

informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Agenda

### Elixir for Rubyists

[David Salgado](https://digitalronin.github.io/) is going to tell us about [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/):

> The Elixir programming language  has been generating
> a lot of buzz in the Ruby community recently. This presentation gives an
> introduction to Elixir, discussing some of the things that make it so popular
> among rubyists, and outlining a few of the similarities and differences
> between Elixir and Ruby.

### The full power of Redis

Daniel Magliola is going to tell us about [Redis](http://redis.io/):

> The vast majority of projects use Redis like it's Memcached, but Redis can
> give so much more. In this talk I'll give practical examples of use cases
> where Redis outshines everything else I've tried.

### A reintroduction to codebar

[Kimberley Cook](https://twitter.com/kimberleycook91) is going to tell us about [Codebar](https://codebar.io/):

> In this talk I will discuss what codebar is, how we have expanded over the
> last 2 years and how you can help us improve.

## Afterwards

We aim to finish the talks by 8pm, but that's not where the meeting ends.  If you'd like to continue chatting to other attendees you have a choice:

1. Stay at Code Node where Skills Matter have a cash bar and you can mingle with attendees of other meetups held that night.
2. Head over to [the Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)) where you can get some food to chew over along with the discussions spurred by the talks.

Attendance at the talks isn't required to come along for the socialising part of the meeting, so please do head over if you can't make the earlier part.

## Venue & Registration {#mar16registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7883-london-ruby-user-group-march-2016-meeting).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7883-london-ruby-user-group-march-2016-meeting).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-march/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos, slides, writeups, code, etc.

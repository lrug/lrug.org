## Agenda

### JRuby+Truffle: A faster but simpler new Ruby

[Dr Chris Seaton](http://chrisseaton.com/) is building a new ruby interpreter and wants to tell us all about it:

> JRuby+Truffle is a new Ruby interpreter from Oracle Labs. While it uses
> cutting-edge compiler technology to achieve high performance, the concepts
> and implementation of most of JRuby+Truffle are actually rather simple -
> simpler than MRI, JRuby or Rubinius, and needing only techniques that can be
> explained in a few slides.

### Doing Things Differently at Reevoo

[Jonny Arnold](https://twitter.com/JonnyArnold89) is going to tell us about some agile practices:

> Reevoo is already an Agile company: we have JIRA Agile, so we must be, right?
>
> A few months ago we set out on a greenfield project, and decided to do things
> differently. What would happen when we went back to sticky notes and
> whiteboards for planning? Could we deliver on time for a project if we never
> set a deadline? And what happens when half of the development team changes
> every two weeks? Come along to our public retrospective on what went well and
> what we would never do again.

### Continuous Feedback

[Chris Blackburn](https://twitter.com/burgersnatch) says:

> How we left behind old-fashioned performance reviews by applying the things
> we're taught to value in modern software delivery to our people.

## Afterwards

These talks should end around about 8pm.  The night isn't over at that point though; many other attendees will be hanging around and it's a good chance to chat about things raised in the talks, or just to meet up with other rubyists and discuss what's been going on in the ruby scene.  If you'd like to continue chatting to other attendees you have a choice:

1. Stay at Code Node where Skills Matter have a cash bar and you can mingle with attendees of other meetups held that night.
2. Head over to [the Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)) where you can get some food to chew over along with the discussions spurred by the talks.

Even if you can't make the talks you should definitely feel free to head over to one of these venues to hang out.

## Venue & Registration {#apr16registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7987-lrug-april-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7987-lrug-april-meetup).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-april/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos, slides, writeups, code, etc.

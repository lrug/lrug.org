Agenda
------

### Working together

[Josh Hill](https://twitter.com/jamesjoshuahill) wants to share his experiences with pair-programming:

> Josh heard about pair programming a few years ago and tried it a few
> times. Last year, he jumped in and started pairing full-time. Working so
> closely with clients, colleagues, juniors and seniors was challenging. Now he
> enjoys pairing more than flying solo and has seen the benefits for himself
> and his teammates. This talk is about the challenges and benefits of working
> more closely with one another.

### Total Rewrite

[David Salgado](https://twitter.com/digitalronin) has some tips for tackling the dreaded re-write:

> Patterns and anti-patterns for when you're replacing your entire codebase,
> and reasons why doing that is (usually) a very bad idea.

### Not working together

[Gerhard Lazu](https://twitter.com/gerhardlazu) asks:

> How does a small team spread across London & Omaha set up a global
> production infrastructure while not working together?

Afterwards
----------

The meeting will finish around about 8pm when the prepared talks are over.  It's now up to you and the other attendees to have unprepared talks in the comfort of one of these venues:

1. The downstairs area at Code Node.  Skills Matter have a cash bar with a choice of drinks on offer.  If there are other meetups on the same night you can hang out with those attendees too and find out what's going on in other technology communities.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  For those who want to eat as well as drink after the talks, you'll find many LRUG attendees here.  There's a wide selection of drinks, and some tasty food on offer too.

If you are unable to attend the talks you don't need to miss out, you can absolutely come along to meet us afterwards.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8244-lrug-september-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8244-lrug-september-meetup).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-september/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos, slides, writeups, code, etc.

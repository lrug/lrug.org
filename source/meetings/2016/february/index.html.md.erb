  > pull requests to other open source projects. In this talk you will be

### [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com) - "Automatic differentiation in Ruby"

  > Finding the derivative of a mathematical function on a computer can be
  > difficult, but there’s a clever trick that makes it easy: first write a

  > that works in Ruby.

## Pub

There's bound to be something to talk about after all those talks and we now have two options for winding down the evening and chatting to other LRUG attendees:

1. Stay at Code Node where Skills Matter have a cash bar and you can mingle with attendees of other meetups held that night.
2. Take the short walk to [the Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)) where you can get some food to chew over along with the discussions spurred by the talks.

Talks should finish at about 8pm so if you can't make it along earlier feel free to come along to either venue afterwards to hang out.

## Venue & Registration {#feb16registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7698-lrug-february-2016-lightning-talks-meeting).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7698-lrug-february-2016-lightning-talks-meeting).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-february/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

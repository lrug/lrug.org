## Agenda

### Development Re-bundling in Dockerland

[Charlie Egan](https://twitter.com/charlieegan3) has some tips for developers
using docker and bundler:

> For almost a year I've enjoyed using Docker and docker-compose to work on
> various Ruby projects. However - bundle installations when building images
> have been always been painful. This talk is about exploring the rather
> unsatisfactory options available to speed up the process of "development
> re-bundling".

### A month of I18n in 10 minutes

[Chris Radford](https://twitter.com/chrisradford) is going to tell us how to
make i18n a smooth process:

> Translating websites has been A Thing(tm) since the earliest days of the
> web, so how does it take over a month to translate a website with less
> than a dozen pages? In this talk Chris walks us through the minefield of
> internationalisation and some of the common pitfalls of translating a
> website.

### Joining the mob: Top 12 mob programming tips and thoughts

[Emma Beynon](https://twitter.com/emmabeynon) wants to share how she and
her team got on with mob-programming:

> What happens when you get 5 developers to work on the same problem on the
> same computer at the same time?  Emma's team at GDS took collaboration to
> the next level by trying out mob programming. Find out what they learned
> from their mobbing experience, and take away a few tips to try it in your
> team.

### An open-source contribution story

[Murray Steele](https://twitter.com/hlame) has a story to tell:

> A short story about a contribution I made to rubygems that took a couple
> of years. And how that's totally ok.

## Afterwards

Our talks will be done by 8:45pm after which you can find LRUG attendees in one
of these venues:

1. The downstairs area at Code Node.  Skills Matter have a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks on offer.  If there are other meetups on the same night
   you can hang out with those attendees too and find out what's going on in
   other technology communities.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road,
   EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  For those who want to eat as well
   as drink after the talks, you'll find many LRUG attendees here.  There's
   a wide selection of drinks, and some tasty food on offer too.

Attendance of the talks isn't a requirement for coming along to the afterwards
part.  Do turn up and say "hi!", you'll be more than welcome.

## Venue & Registration {#oct16registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks, or afterwards in the pub.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8500-development-re-bundling-in-dockerland-and-a-month-of-i18n-in-10-minutes).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out
with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the
larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also,
it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8500-development-re-bundling-in-dockerland-and-a-month-of-i18n-in-10-minutes).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-october/),
but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly
use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos,
slides, writeups, code, etc.

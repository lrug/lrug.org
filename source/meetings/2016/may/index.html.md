The May 2016 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 9th of May*, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm (talks start at 6:30pm).  The venue, [Code Node](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode) between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is provided by [Skills Matter](http://www.skillsmatter.com).  [Full venue and registration details are given below](#may16registration).

Agenda
------

### The Art of Code Review

[John Cinnamond](ttps://twitter.com/jcinnamond) says:

> Most of us do some form of code review, increasingly often through pull
> requests. Done well it can be a great tool for improving quality, sharing
> knowledge, and building a sense of cohesion in a team. Done badly it can be
> toxic. In this talk I’d like to look at the motivations for code review,
> examine research into its value, and suggest some practices on how to do it
> well.

### A Tale of Two Deployments - Machine Images, Immutable Servers And Green/Blue Deployment

[Asfand Yar Qazi](http://www.thedevopsdoctors.com/) says:

> Imagine some of the worst things that could happen to you during `cap deploy`
> -- well, they happened to Ali on the same day, and it turned into one of the
> worst days of his life. Interestingly, Sally in the office across the street
> had the exact same issues come up during her deployment. However her team had
> invested in their infrastructure sensibly, and deployed fresh immutable
> server clusters from pre-built machine images on each deploy. She could just
> relax, as the infrastructure had been designed to filter out most problems
> that could occur during deployment. Here is their story!

### Convox: Painless deployment of Docker on AWS

[Matthew Ford](https://twitter.com/matthewcford) says:

> Bit Zesty have been playing with Docker to help with Dev/Prod parity, but
> deploying and managing Docker images in production has been a pain. Convox
> helps by providing a simple Heroku-esque CLI to deploy and manage your
> application on AWS. We've been able to replace a bunch of terraform +
> chef/ansible scripts and use Docker in production without the headache.

Afterwards
----------

We should be done with the talks by 8pm at which point have a choice to make:

1. Stay at Code Node where Skills Matter have a cash bar and you can mingle with attendees of other meetups held that night.
2. Head over to [the Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)) where you'll find a wide selection of food and drinks to choose from and a bunch of LRUG members to chat with.

If you're unable to attend the talks it's more than acceptable to come along to one of these venues to hang out with the rest of the LRUG members.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8095-lrug-may-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8095-lrug-may-meetup).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-may/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos, slides, writeups, code, etc.

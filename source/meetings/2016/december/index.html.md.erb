## Agenda

###  Software architecture analysis with runtime type detection in ruby

[Mark Burns](https://twitter.com/_mark_burns) says:

> The six lesser-known SOLID (packaging) principles, Connascence, and tooling
> for runtime type analysis in ruby. Summarised in haiku form as:
>
>     Fitting code on screen
>     Makes developers happy;
>     A hypothesis.

### An A/B test is for life, not just for Christmas

[Simon Coffey](https://twitter.com/urbanautomaton) says:

> A/B tests are simple: you have a change you want to make; you define what
> "conversion" is; you randomly show the change to half your users, and see
> if "conversion" goes up or down with the change. But what if the effects
> are more complex?
>
> I'll talk about an experiment we ran that initially targeted a single
> measure of conversion but had some knock-on effects, and how we were able
> to study them. I'll share some very easy things you can do right away to
> get more information out of your A/B tests, and hopefully convince you
> there's more to them than deciding on some copy, or the colour of a button.

## Afterwards

These talks should bring us up to about 8pm.  The meeting doesn't end there
though, if you've a mind to keep things going you have a choice:

1. Stay at Code Node.  Skills Matter have a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks on offer.  There are other meetups hosted by Skills Matter
   on the same night so you can mingle with attendees of those events to find
   out what's happening in those communities.
2. Head to [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City
   Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This is where you'll find many
   LRUG attendees who fancy a drink and a bite to eat.

If you are unable to attend the talks you are still more than welcome to come
along for this part of the meeting.  The more the merrier.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8501-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup).  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8501-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup).

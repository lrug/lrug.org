## Agenda

### Ruby Book Club

[Nadia Odunayo](https://twitter.com/nodunayo) is going to treat us to a "live" episode of her podcast [Ruby Book Club](http://rubybookclub.com/):

> Hello and welcome to the Ruby Book Club! We’re delighted that you could join
> us.
>
> Today we’re starting with section 4.9 in [Avdi Grimm’s ‘Confident
> Ruby’](http://www.confidentruby.com/): Replace “string typing” with classes.
>
> As always, it doesn’t matter if you haven’t found time to do the reading. At
> the Ruby Book Club, we like to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

### Documenting Ruby APIs

[Tom Kadwill](https://twitter.com/tomkadwill) says this about his talk:

> In this talk I will provide a short comparison of the popular API
> documentation tools available for Ruby. I'll explain how you can use them to
> generate API documentation for your own projects.

### Integrating React into a Rails application

[Edd Sowden](https://twitter.com/edds) is going to tell us all about React and Rails:

> Looking at how you can start using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
> within a Rails environment, why you might want to, and what benefits it can
> unlock. Also looking at how you can make this change to a large project which
> lots of developers contribute to regularly.

## Afterwards

The talks will end by 8pm, but that's not the end of the LRUG meeting. There are a couple of options for how to continue your evening with other LRUG attendees.  You can:

1. Hang out in the downstairs area at Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar and you can mingle with attendees of other meetups held that night.
2. Take a short walk northwards and visit [the Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  Many LRUG folk head here to get something to eat with their post-talk drinks, and you'd be more than welcome to join them.

All are welcome at this post-talk part of the meeting where no registration is required.  Feel free to turn up just for this part if you can't make it to the talks earlier in the evening.

## Venue & Registration {#jul16registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8241-integrating-react-into-a-rails-application-and-documenting-ruby-apis).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8241-integrating-react-into-a-rails-application-and-documenting-ruby-apis).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-july/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos, slides, writeups, code, etc.

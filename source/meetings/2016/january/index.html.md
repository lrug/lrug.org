Agenda
------

### From monolith to microservices: A true story

[Andy White](http://andywhite.org) wants to tell us about the microservices architecture they use at [Quill Content](http://www.quillcontent.com/):

> How we moved from a huge Rails monolith to small microservices - the how and
> the why.

### The journey to Primed.is

[Neil Robertson](https://twitter.com/Whatthenar) & [Jake Prime](https://twitter.com/jakeprime) want to tell us about [Primed.is](http://primed.is).  First Neil will quickly introduce us to Primed.is:

> Primed.is - improving recruitment pain
>
> Recruitment is a pain, isn't it? Does it have to be this way? We say
> 'no' and we want to show you why. Primed.is a web application to
> tackle common recruitment problems and we can't wait to tell you all
> about it.

Then Jake will talk to us about his journey while building it:

> A Guide to Becoming a Ruby on Rails Developer
>
> After working as a Flash developer and team lead for 10 years I have
> switched to become a Ruby on Rails developer to build our new product,
> Primed. This is the talk I would like to have heard a year ago when I
> was beginning that journey.

### Using direnv with ruby and 12factor apps

[Jonas Pfenniger Chevalier](http://zimbatm.com) will show us a new environment switcher tool he's written called direnv:

> [direnv](http://direnv.net) is a language-agnostic environment switching tool
> that I wrote a 5 years ago and still use every day.
>
> This talk is going to present the tool and it's capabilities, and then explore
> how it can be used by ruby developers. Hopefully it will be useful to you in
> the everyday life as a developer, or just spark some interesting
> conversations.

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7697-lrug-january-2016-meeting).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7697-lrug-january-2016-meeting).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

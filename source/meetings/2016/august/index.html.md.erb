[Full venue and registration details are given below](#aug16registration).

## Agenda

### Action Cable

[Jairo Diaz](https://codescrum.com) is going to tell us about the newest addition to rails:

> [Action Cable](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actioncable) is a
> Rails framework for real-time communication over websockets introduced in
> Rails 5.0. With Action Cable we can develop interactive applications and live
> notifications to our users.

### The Marvel Guide to Developers

[Melinda Seckington](https://missgeeky.com) wants to talk to us about superhero developers:

> Forget ninja developers and rockstar developers. What I'm more interested in
> is the superhero developer: these are the developers that do their best to
> help others, that try to give back to their community, and generally make the
> world a better place.
>
> So how can we all strive to be superhero developers? Using the origin stories
> and lessons from Marvel superheroes, this talk will help you become the type
> of developer that amplifies and helps others.

### Tell, Donâ€™t Ask

[John Cinnamond](https://twitter.com/jcinnamond) has a deleted-scene from his Brighton Ruby talk on OO programming to share with us:

> Everything you ever need to know about how to write the most wonderful code, in 10 minutes.

## Afterwards

We'll be done with the talks by about 8pm.  If you'd like to continue talking to your fellow LRUG attendees about the topics brought up by the speakers, goings on in the ruby community at large, or anything else you have a choice to make.  You can:

1. Hang out in the downstairs area at Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar and you can mingle with attendees of other meetups held that night.
2. Take a short walk northwards and visit [the Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)) for some food to go with your post-talk drink.

If you can't make the talks you are more than welcome to come along afterwards to hang out with us.

## Venue & Registration {#aug16registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8243-lrug-august-meetup).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8243-lrug-august-meetup).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-august/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos, slides, writeups, code, etc.

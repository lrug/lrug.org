## Agenda

### The invisible cost of code

[Luke Morton](https://twitter.com/lukemorton) says:

> Every line of code has cost associated with it. The cost of writing it. The
> cost of testing it. Deploying it. Reading it. Changing it later. I'd like to
> identify some of the costs and suggest ways of reducing them. Hint: write
> less code in the first place.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk & Docker for Rails developers.

[Tomas Valent](https://twitter.com/equivalent8) says:

> Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is a product from AWS that is trying to provide easy
> to setup load balanced environment of EC2 instances.
>
> In this talk we will configure simple Rails app, wrap it in a Docker container
> and ship it to AWS EB setup.  We will look at some awesome configuration
> options.

### Where does my code go? - Rails Edition

Michael Lennox says:

> While Rails provides us a great platform for rapid application development
> it doesn't give us much guidance on where to start placing common
> abstractions once our domain complexity grows. This talk isn't about the
> 'architecture astronaut' or fighting rails to implement 'better' patterns,
> it's a really basic intro to some of the layers you can implement tomorrow
> to compartmentalise your code without having to fight the framework.

### Food and Drinks

{::sponsor name="Cogent" size="main" /}

The nice people at [Cogent](http://cogent.co/) have arranged to provide us
with some pizza and drinks.  These will be available before the meeting in
the Skilss Matter downstairs bar area, so there's even more reasons to turn
up early.  Cogent are a software agency in Melbourne, Australia, and are
looking to hire ruby devs, if you're interested they'll help you relocate.

Thanks for supporting us [Cogent](http://cogent.co)!

## Afterwards

The talks part of the meeting ends around 8:00pm.  If you'd like to continue the
evening you have a choice of where to go next:

1. The downstairs area at Code Node.  Skills Matter have a cash bar with a
   choice of drinks on offer.  There are other meetups hosted by Skills Matter
   on the same night so you can mingle with attendees of those events to find
   out what's happening in those communities.
2. [The Singer Tavern](http://singertavern.com/) (located at [1 City Road,
   EC1Y 1AG](https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu)).  This is where you'll find many
   LRUG attendees who fancy a drink and a bite to eat.

If you are unable to attend the talks you are still more than welcome to come
along for this part of the meeting.  The more the merrier.

## Venue & Registration {#nov16registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
[README](http://readme.lrug.org/) paying close attention to [the code of
conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.

### Venue

The address of the venue:

> Skills Matter CodeNode<br/>10 South Place<br/>London<br/>EC2M 2RB<br/><br/>[See on a map](https://goo.gl/maps/ONJT4)

### Registration

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts
Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8526-lrug-meetup).  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do [register with Skills
Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8526-lrug-meetup).

You can also find [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-november/),
but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly
use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos,
slides, writeups, code, etc.

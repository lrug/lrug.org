The July 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 14th of July*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#jul14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### Continuous Deliverance - set your development free

[John Maxwell](http://jgwmaxwell.com/) wants to talk to us about automated deployment:

> The first principle of the Agile Manifesto says “Our highest
> priority is to satisfy the customer through early and 
> continuous delivery of valuable software”, yet too often this
> is not the reality. Delivery is one of the most disruptive
> parts of the software development process for developers, but
> can be easy to automate, empowering the iterative process. 
> This talk is a manifesto for how to go from scratch to 
> automated deployment, with a few tales from the trenches of
> mistakes made along the way.

### Welcome back to RSpec

[Tom Stuart](http://codon.com/) is going to re-introduce us to RSpec:

> [RSpec 3](https://relishapp.com/rspec/) has just been released, and it's come a long way since
> [version 1](http://rspec.info). If you've had problems with RSpec in the past, now 
> is a great time to revisit it — it's become much cleaner, simpler
> and more focused. I'll give a quick overview of the main things 
> that have changed over the years, and if there's time, I'll 
> explain a few of the new features in version 3.

### Becoming a Developer & Codebar

[Rosa Fox](http://www.techfox.co.uk/) will give us a talk she describes as:

> A short talk about my experience starting out as a professional
> developer. The focus of this talk will be about a weekly event
> through which I received a huge amount of support called [Codebar](http://codebar.io). 
> At Codebar programming skills are taught for free to people 
> underrepresented in the tech industry. 

Pub
---

Our talks finish up around 8pm and you can find us crowding [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) by about 8:10pm.  We're a friendly group and this part of the evening is the perfect time to talk to the speakers and other attendees about the talks or other goings-on in the wider Ruby world.  If you didn't make the talks you're still welcome to come along for this pub bit!

---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6451-welcome-back-to-rspec-continuous-deliverance).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6451-welcome-back-to-rspec-continuous-deliverance).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-july/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

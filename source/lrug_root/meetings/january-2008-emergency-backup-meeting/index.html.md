Due to organisational problems, the proposed January Pub Quiz (we're trying to start a [tradition](/meetings/2006/12/07/january-2007-pub-quiz-meeting/)) has been postponed until a later date.  It'll probably be run in March as a special [LRUG Nights](/nights/).

In the interim the January emergency backup meeting is on Monday the 14th of January, from 6:30pm onwards at [The Chandos](http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub1054.html) pub in central London.  There's no agenda, other than to mull over the [recent events](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/12/25/ruby-1-9-0-released/), [new releases](http://www.ruby-forum.com/search?query=ANN&forums%5B%5D=4&forums%5B%5D=3&max_age=1+month) and [gossip](http://zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html) from the ruby community over the festive break.

See you all there.

The July 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 15th of July, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  <a href="#jul13registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### The reluctant Chef

[Simon Coffey](https://twitter.com/urbanautomaton) says:

> Most developers don't do ops, and though the idea of devops
> is slowly permeating through the industry, it's probably 
> not the norm yet. So why should we, as devs, care about 
> configuration management? What has it done for us lately?
>
> I'll try to explain how Chef can improve your life, even if
> you never touch a production server. I'll give some 
> examples of ways in which configuration management can 
> simplify your development environment, improve your 
> debugging abilities, and give you a better overall 
> understanding of the way your applications fit together. 
>
> I'll also share some strategies for breaking down the 
> intimidating task of introducing Chef if you've already got
> hand-configured servers, so that change can be gradual, 
> with progress along the way as nature intended. I'll also 
> mention some of the tools that make life much, much simpler.

### Building and maintaining a Ruby team during the Rails crisis of 2013

[Louis Goff-Beardsley](https://twitter.com/LouisRoR) says:

> 1. There’s a massive shortage of Ruby developers.
>
> 2. Over the last year I’ve worked with numerous teams 
>    implementing creative, non-standard ways to building and 
>    maintaining teams.
>
> 3. I’m going to talk about them.
>
> 4. This will be relevant to existing teams and people 
>    thinking of starting a team in the future. Overall I think
>    it will be beneficial & interesting for everyone, even if 
>    you’re not thinking of starting your own team any time soon.

### Drinks!

The nice folks at [Workshare](http://www.workshare.com/) have arranged to have some drinks made available *during* the meeting, so it's an even better idea than usual to <a href="#jul13registration">register your attendance</a> and secure your place!

Pub
---

Our talks finish up no later than 8pm, but that's not the end of the evening.  Most of us wander over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to have a chat.  You don't have to attend the talks to turn up for the pub, so please do come along!

Registration <a name="jul13registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-hosts-simon-coffey-and-louis-goff-beardsley).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-hosts-simon-coffey-and-louis-goff-beardsley).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-july/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

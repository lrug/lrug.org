The May 2014 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday the 12th of May*, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/96-skills-matter-exchange).  <a href="#may14registration">Registration details are given below</a>.

Agenda
------

### Learning to Code

[Angela Ebirim](https://twitter.com/obia67) has been attending the [Funding Circle Code Craft](http://tech.fundingcircle.com/codecraft/) course and is going to give us a lightning talk:

> It'll be about my adventures, frustrations and triumphs in learning to code and specifically in Ruby.

### How to win developers and influence designers

[Adam Rogers](https://twitter.com/rodreegez) has a talk for us about working as a team better:

> In 1936, Dale Carnegie wrote the book ["How to win friends and influence people"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0091906814/). 
> You may have heard of it. But what can this book, and others, teach us about 
> working as part of a software team today? Quite a lot, actually.
>
> We'll look at a few points that'll help us to work better, together.

### Deprecating ActiveResource: Alternative Approaches for Internal Rails Services

[Gabe da Silveira](https://twitter.com/dasil003) is going to talk to us about ActiveResource:

> Ruby on Rails has always been optimized for a single monolithic application
> architecture.  But as applications grow, it has become more and more common 
> for architects to seek out ways to break their monolithic Rails apps into 
> self-contained services.  For years the most natural answer of how to hook
> up one Rails app to another's API has been to use ActiveResource, a core 
> Rails plugin that provides an ActiveRecord-like interface to an external service.
> 
> The allure of such a simple interface to a network service is undeniable, but
> the downsides not nearly as obvious.  Many have built Rails apps relying on 
> ActiveResource only to feel significant unforeseen pain down the line.  This 
> talk provides a case study of an early adopter of ActiveResource during the 
> Rails 1.2 era, the pain that it led to, and the eventual replacement of
> ActiveResource with a bespoke private gem that provides a similar, but more
> robust interface.

Pub
---

The second part of the evening starts after the talks finish, which is usually around 8pm, and we move from Skills Matter's offices to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/).  If you can't make the talks do feel free to head over to the pub to join us for this more informal side to the meeting.

Registration <a name="may14registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6382-learning-to-code-how-to-win-developers-and-deprecating-activeresource).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6382-learning-to-code-how-to-win-developers-and-deprecating-activeresource).  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our [README](http://readme.lrug.org/).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-may/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

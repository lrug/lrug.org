The February 2013 meeting of LRUG will be on *Monday* the 11th of February, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; [The Skills Matter eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96).  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#feb13registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.

Agenda
------

### Lightning talks!

February is our annual lightning talk evening and as usual we're using the 20x20 format for the talks.  If you've never encountered this format before it's when the speaker has 20 slides that auto-transition after 20 seconds, giving them a total of 6 minutes and 40 seconds in which to get their point across.

Our confirmed volunteers for 2012 are:

* [Yann Armand](http://blog.harakys.com/): HULK SMASH! (your db column, not your whole app)
* [Paul Battley](http://po-ru.com/): 1 + 2 = 3
* [Pablo Brasero Moreno](http://pablobm.com/): Extremist Programming
* [Steve Buckley](http://twitter.com/StevieBuckley): Contractor Rates & Salaries for Ruby Devs in London
* [Seb Jacobs](http://sebjacobs.com/): mruby
* [Nasir Jamal](http://twitter.com/_nasj): Love your Pull Requests
* [Gerhard Lazu](http://gerhardlazu.com/): What would Jason Bourne do?
* [Randy Morgan](https://github.com/randym): Polyglottous emberjs with rake-pipeline and localeapp
* [Anurag Priyam](https://github.com/yeban): Afra: collectively mapping genomes

Pub

Once we finish up with the talks we head over to [The Slaughtered Lamb](http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/) to continue the evening in more informal, if admittedly slightly noisier surroundings.  If you can't make it for the talks feel free to pop along to the pub for about 8pm, which is when we usually finish up.

Also, the nice folks at [Globaldev](http://www.globaldev.co.uk/) are sponsoring some drinks behind the bar, so it's an even better idea to come along than usual.

Registration <a name="feb13registration">&nbsp;</a>
---------------------------------------------------

To secure a place at the meeting you *must* [register with our hosts Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-lightening-talks).  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget [MINASWAN](http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036)), so please do [register with Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/lrug-lightening-talks).

You can also follow [this meeting on lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/lrug-february/), but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?

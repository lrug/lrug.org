Episode 5 of LRUG Nights will take place on Thursday 1st November at "The Blue Posts":http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub1.html, near Tott. Court Road / Goodge Street Tubes. There are rumours in the underworld that we may have some sub standard allies to assist us in our crime-busting exploits.

Drink some beer, maybe finally solve "the Japanese Ruby mystery".

I'll be there from 6.30-7pm - dressed, of course, as "the Gigolo":http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/just-a-gigolo/episode/41745/summary.html

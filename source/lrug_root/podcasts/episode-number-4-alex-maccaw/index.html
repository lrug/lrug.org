In this episode I'm joined by <a href="http://alexmaccaw.co.uk">Alex MacCaw</a>. Alex is a <a href="https://github.com/maccman">prolific</a> Ruby and JavaScript developer. With an entrepreneurial spirit he's also the creator of <a href="http://www.taskforceapp.com/">Taskforce</a> and has spent time in the San Francisco start-up community. 

In this episode we talk about all of these things as well as the state of Ruby on the desktop and the future of web applications.

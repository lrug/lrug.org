## So you want to talk at LRUG?

Great! LRUG welcomes anyone that wants to come and talk, thanks for thinking about volunteering!

### What should I talk about?

We're a [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) user group, so there should be something remotely ruby-ish to your talk.  Even if it's not directly related to ruby, it should be something that a rubyist would be interested in.  For example, many rubyists are web developers (via [rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)) and firm believers in testing and development methodologies, so anything about those would be interesting.  However don't let that limit your talk ideas - if you're a rubyist and _you_ think it's interesting, chances are we will too.

### Who should I get in touch with?

You have a couple of options:

1. If you're at an LRUG event of some sort (a [meeting](/meetings) or [night](/nights)) then look for whomever appears to have organised the event and talk to them about it.  Currently that's likely to be [Murray Steele](http://h-lame.com/), but it might be someone else.
2. If you can't make the meeting, or couldn't find the organiser get on the [mailing list](http://lists.lrug.org/listinfo.cgi/chat-lrug.org) and suggest your talk.

Even if you choose option 1 you should try out option 2 as well.  You'll get some feedback from LRUG [members](/members-and-friends) about what they'd like to hear covered in your talk, and that can be invaluable when you're preparing it.

### When will the next meeting be?

As you can see from our [about page](/about-us) page we have formal meetings once a month.  The schedule is fairly fixed, but the meetings tend not to be [announced on the website](/meetings) until the details are firm, so you should check [the LRUG page on upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/1589/), [mailing list](http://lists.lrug.org/listinfo.cgi/chat-lrug.org) or [twitter account](http://twitter.com/lrug) to see if it's been pre-announced on those.

### Anything else I should know?

Over the years, we've collected some [tips for speakers](/speaking-old/tips) that cover timings, connecting up your laptop and even suggestions about colour schemes for your slides.  Check them out [here](/speaking-old/tips).

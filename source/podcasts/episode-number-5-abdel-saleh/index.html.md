<p>In this episode I'm joined by Abdel Saleh of <a href="http://said.fm">said.fm</a> a Radio and Podcast recommendation and curation startup. Abdel has been involved in the London Ruby community for many years and we cover a lot of ground in this interview - from transitioning from Java to Ruby in Finance, through Machine Learning and computation on AWS clusters to the ins- and outs of getting a startup off the ground both here and in Silicon Valley. </p>

<p>Here's some links to things Abdel talked about during the interview:</p>

      Enemy images hinder our communication with people when we need them
      the most: to agree with another colleague over a code review, to interview
      a third party, to have an important conversation with our boss or direct
      report (technical or non-technical topic).
      In this talk we will raise awareness and cover one way of overcoming the
      initial enemy image to get a better outcome for us and our team.

    description: |-
      Fast deploy pipelines are an important facet of a fast moving engineering
      team; allowing you to ship smaller, safer units of value to production, [faster](https://xkcd.com/303/),
      and more often.

      In this talk we'll be covering how using [git tree objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#_tree_objects)
      can allow you to run CI less or potentially not at all (in a not scary manner :)
      after merging your changes into your default branch, allowing you to get straight
      to deploying! 🚂

      In cases where your team can precompile deployment
      artefacts your changes could make it into production in under 60s. If your
      team uses Heroku or Buildpacks to deploy your code, I'll point you to
      [some](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/build-an-app/) [tricks](https://github.com/CGA1123/slugcmplr)
      to help you do just that by detaching building and releasing your application

      Recently, in one of our Ruby on Rails projects in which we wanted to generate PDF documents for
      invoices, we decided to use another programming language and technology: React
      and AWS Lambda.

      In this talk, we will be covering how we did it, what were
      the challenges and what pros and cons over the incumbent tools for Ruby.

      they built over a weekend had nearly 50,000 registrations on the day it
      launched. Two years later, after building lots more services (using
      Ruby… of course) and serving millions of users, the [GOV.UK][]
      Coronavirus team finally disbanded.

      Rosa and Leena will take LRUG through a timeline of [GOV.UK][]’s
      response to the pandemic. We will discuss what we delivered, our
      successes, failures and how the team supported each other to cope. We
      will share how Ruby/Rails and tools such as the [GOV.UK][] Design System

      You have a complex PR to submit. You've tried to keep it small, but sadly

      lot of effort and your branch has more than 30 commits with fixes and
      reverting of dead ends.

      You know reviewing this will be a nightmare for your colleagues, and more
      importantly, it will be almost impossible for someone in the future to
      understand what happened if they ever look at the history.

      In this talk we will look at how Git branches work, and how to manicure
      them using Rebase to build a commit history your colleagues will love you

      It’s not just funding and regulations either. You also need to back it up with the right technology and tools to manage a highly complex business where mistakes can be very costly. On top of that, startups need to move fast to out-innovate the incumbents with only a fraction of the resources.

      At Generation Home Ruby has been a catalyst to help us deliver a product we’re proud of in a short time-scale. We’ll talk about some of the challenges we faced early on, how Ruby, Rails and the whole ecosystem helped us deliver and what still lays ahead of us.

      Understanding our applications' performance can be tricky. Some of the readily available performance tools introduce a big overhead which makes them not suitable for use in production environments, where in many cases, it's the best place to troubleshoot performance issues.

      [rbperf](https://github.com/javierhonduco/rbperf/) is a low-overhead on-CPU profiler and tracer that is suitable for usage in production environments. It doesn't require the application under investigation to be restarted or disturbed in any way.

      We will discuss some of the tradeoffs in its design, its architecture, the features that make it unique, as well as its limitations compared to other tools. We will also take a look at how the Ruby stack is laid out in memory and the role BPF plays in rbperf.

    description: |-
      That strange phenomenon where air molecules bounce against each other in a way that somehow comforts you, makes you cry, or makes you dance all night: music. Since the advent of recorded audio, a musician doesn't even need to be present anymore for this to happen (which makes putting "I will always love you" on repeat a little less awkward).

      Musicians and sound engineers have found many ways of creating music, and making music sound good when played from a record. Some of their methods have become industry staples used on every recording released today.

      Let's look at what they do and reproduce some of their methods in Ruby!

    title: Data Indexing with RGB (Ruby, Graphs and Bitmaps)
    description: |-
      In this talk, we will go on a journey through Zappi’s data history and how
      we are using Ruby, a graph database, and a bitmap store to build a unique
      data engine. A journey that starts with the problem of a disconnected data
      set and serialised data frames, and ends with the solution of an in-memory
      index.

      We will explore how we used RedisGraph to model the relationships in our
      data, connecting semantically equal nodes. Then delve into how a query
      layer was used to index a bitmap store and, in turn, led to us being able
      to interrogate our entire dataset orders of magnitude faster than before.

    title: "`ruby/debug` - The best investment for your productivity"
    description: |-
      In this talk, I will demonstrate 3 powerful debugging techniques using Ruby's new debugger [`ruby/debug`](https://github.com/ruby/debug):

      * Step-debugging
      * Frame navigation
      * Breakpoint commands

      By using them together, we can reduce unnecessary context switching and make our debugging sessions more efficient. You will also learn more about `ruby/debug` while we walk through these techniques with its commands and console.

      And finally, I will show you how to level up our productivity even further by automating debugging steps using `ruby/debug`'s scriptable breakpoints.

      When talking about performance, most developers think application speed,
      faster algorithms or better data structures. But what about your test
      suite? CI time is developer waiting time!

      At Shopify we have more than 170,000 Ruby tests and we add 30,000 more
      annually. The sheer amount of tests and their growth requires some
      aggressive methods. We will illustrate some of our techniques including
      monitoring, test selection, timeouts and the 80/20 rule. If you have
      experience in writing tests and want to learn tricks on how to speed up
      your test suite, this talk is for you!

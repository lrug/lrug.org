      Rails lost its way during versions 4, 5, and 6 - becoming overly complex and slow as it leaned heavily into JavaScript. But the story doesn’t end there. With Rails 8.1 introducing features like Stimulus, Action Cable, and Solid Cable, the framework is returning to its roots: simplicity, speed, and developer joy.

      Join us for a deep dive into why Rails has its mojo back and what this means for the future of Ruby developmen

      In this talk, Sebastian will dive into RSpec as a craft — showing how thoughtful test design can make refactoring less terrifying. You’ll see real-world examples of transforming low-signal specs into readable, behaviour-driven tests, and learn how Junie, an IDE-native AI assistant, can act as a second pair of eyes to improve naming, structure, and guarantees.

      This is a practical, opinionated look at using AI to support test quality—while keeping human judgment firmly in control.

      Why join?

      - Many test suites pass—and still make refactoring terrifying. Why?
      - Explore clarity, intent, and refactor safety in RSpec.
      - See how AI can enhance craftsmanship without replacing developers.

      At [BBB](https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/), we use feature flags extensively in one of our Rails applications.

      Removing fully rolled-out feature flags is always a chore that’s easy to ignore and eventually becomes a source of tech debt. In the talk, I’ll show how we use GitHub Actions and GitHub Copilot to automatically generate PRs that remove obsolete flags and their associated code paths.

      In this talk I'll compare today's AI moment to past tech S-curves, and argue it's not only a toolset change that's required (learning to code agentically) but a deeper change in how we work.

      I'll cover the mindset and capability shifts this demands: outcome ownership, faster feedback loops, more autonomy. I'll cover what engineers can do to meet the moment.

      I'll also share how this is changing the way I think about hiring and scaling teams: what signals matter now, and how we're adapting interview loops to find people who thrive in an agentic world

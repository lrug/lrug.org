      Never say, "Never say die!"
    description: |-
      Ruby is a high-level language, and there's a general assumption that
      it's ill-suited to low-level shenanigans. But is this true?

      In this lightning talk I'll introduce some basic Ruby tools for
      accessing low-level system features, concentrating on *nix platforms,
      and see if it's possible to replicate tenderlove's Never Say Die gem
      for recovering from segfaults.

      Rather than a theoretical comparison, I’ll walk through real-world examples,

      Lately, there has been a lot of development in durable workflows in
      Rails with tools like `active_job_continuation` and `acidic_job`.
      [`stepper_motor`](https://github.com/stepper-motor/stepper_motor) is a
      new tool allowing for identifiable, associable, orchestrated step
      workflows for Rails applications - without gRPC, extra tools or data
      stores. Let's explore where such a system comes from, why every durable
      execution system is secretly a DAG, and how the `stepper_motor`
      architecture is informed by VFX software instead of the imperative
      `ActiveJob` methods.

    description: |-
      This will be a quirky dive into the rudiments of virtual machine and emulator implementation.

      When you're working with Ruby you’re relying on a software machine written by a small but dedicated team of virtual machine enthusiasts. And unless you’ve taken a course in programming language implementation you probably have only a loose idea of what this is, how it works, or how easy it is to write your own machines.

      In this fast-paced introduction I’ll use code written in Ruby to explain the basic building-blocks with which we can model computing machines in software, covering as many of the main architectural features as possible in the time: stacks; heaps; dispatchers; clocks; registers; instruction sets.

      Then I'll put them to a somewhat different use than you might expect.

      This talk contains a lot of code (possibly including a smidgeon of gnarly C) but regardless of you current skill level it will reveal a little of the magic which makes tools like Ruby possible. The examples should also be sufficient to kickstart your own adventures in this fascinating field.

      For years, React has been the go-to choice for building frontend applications
      — but is it always the best solution? In this talk, I’ll share my journey from
      working extensively with React to discovering Hotwire, a radically different
      approach that enables dynamic applications without heavy JavaScript or complex
      state management.

      Rather than a theoretical comparison, I’ll walk through real-world examples,
      demonstrating how I’ve implemented interactive features using Hotwire. I’ll
      also discuss my experiences, the challenges I faced, and some surprising
      discoveries along the way.

      display a little workflow that shows how to use AI to fix bugs faster as
      they happen in production.

      Lately, there has been a lot of development in durable workflows in
      Rails with tools like `active_job_continuation` and `acidic_job`.
      [`stepper_motor`](https://github.com/stepper-motor/stepper_motor) is a
      new tool allowing for identifiable, associable, orchestrated step
      workflows for Rails applications - without gRPC, extra tools or data
      stores. Let's explore where such a system comes from, why every durable
      execution system is secretly a DAG, and how the `stepper_motor`
      architecture is informed by VFX software instead of the imperative
      `ActiveJob` methods.

      * Rails internals: how rails calls render without you needing to ask
      * Using the [Himg](https://github.com/Jamedjo/himg/) library
      * Server side request forgery and injection attacks

When I became a developer advocate at Vonage, I went from gem user to gem maintainer overnight. In this talk I would like to share that journey, and some of the lessons I learned along the way.

    title: Heaping on the Complexity
    description: |-
      Join me on a journey through Ruby's Garbage Collector!

      In this talk I'll teach you some of the details about how the Ruby
      interpreter manages memory. I'll introduce a project my team and I are
      working on that aims to make Ruby faster by improving its memory
      efficiency, and then we'll talk about how our implementation broke
      Garbage Collection.

      After that we'll go on a journey together, through some weeds, and
      taking a few bad turns until we finally emerge with a few PR's that
      not only Fix GC, but make our project better too.

    title: 'What does "high priority" mean? The secret to happy queues'
    description: |-
      Like most web applications, you run important jobs in the background. And
      today, some of your urgent jobs are running late. Again. No matter how many
      changes you make to how you enqueue and run your jobs, the problem keeps
      happening. The good news is you're not alone. Most teams struggle with this
      problem, try more or less the same solutions, and have roughly the same
      result. In the end, it all boils down to one thing: keeping latency low. In
      this talk I will present a latency-focused approach to managing your queues
      reliably, keeping your jobs flowing and your users happy.

      From chewing-gum-and-regex to 35,000 lines of code and YAML! Come hear
      about the past year of work on the solargraph-rails gem. You'll see new
      features, mostly from merging with the solargraph-ARC gem, and hear about
      the lessons learned along the way: more code means more to maintain and
      understand, but there's a surprising amount that can be done just by
      putting one foot in front of the other.

      You’ve heard it hundreds of times: Hybrid apps suck. That may have
      been true in the past, but things have changed significantly in the last decade.
      With tools like Turbo Native working in conjunction with Ruby on Rails, it’s
      possible to mix web technologies with native APIs to build slick hybrid mobile
      apps. We’ll take a look at why the hybrid approach gets such a bad rap, why
      that reputation is undeserved, and how we can build hybrid apps that don''t

      As developers, we know that the best way to learn is by doing. Many of us have

      your own debugger?

      In this talk, I'll show you how to create a mini Ruby debugger that's both
      powerful and fun to use. You'll learn how to:
      - Run your program with debugger with a simple command
      - Set breakpoints and through debugger commands
      - Step through your code to find bugs

      And best of all, you'll do it all in under 300 lines of code!

      Everywhere you look, stories surround us, and everyone has something that’s worth sharing with others. As speakers, we need to understand how to structure our talks so they can have the best effect on the audiences we are trying to reach. How do you discover the right angle and the right story for a talk? How do you frame your story?

      Within tech we know how to approach building a new product: we research our user base, we figure out what and for who we’re trying to create something for and we make sure we constantly iterate on what we’ve come up with. So why aren’t we taking the same approach for our talks?

      This talk will examine how to get in the right mindset of examining your talk ideas, and will introduce a framework of how to design and iterate on your talk. It will focus on several exercises and questions to help you create the best talk for the story you’re trying to tell.

      [Christian Bruckmayer](https://twitter.com/bruckmayer) says:

      > The simplest way of running tests is to run all of them, regardless of what changes you are testing. However, depending on the size of your test suite, this will either get slow or expensive. At Shopify we have almost 300,000 Rails tests and we add 50,000 more annually. The sheer amount of tests and their growth makes it impossible to run all tests, all the time! Hence we implemented a framework to only run tests relevant to your code changes.
      >
      > We will build a test selection framework from scratch in this workshop. We will begin by exploring the fundamentals of such a framework: code analysis. After that we will dive into minitest reporters, how they work and how we can use them to generate a test map. Finally we will use the generated test map to only run tests relevant to your code changes. Attendees will walk away with a solid understanding of what test selection is, how it works and how to implement it.

      This is a workshop, so bring your laptop!

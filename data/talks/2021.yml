      its best features; followed by a short Q&A.

      Working with XSLT/XPath’s XDM type system in Ruby requires learning how to
      translate between two very different type systems in a way which allows for
      idiomatic Ruby without ignoring the bits of XDM which aren’t quite Ruby-shaped.
      Oh, and the only open-source implementation is in Java, so Java’s type system is
      in the mix.

      I’ll look at a couple of cases where the different approaches and
      assumptions of Ruby and XDM (and Java, which just can’t help sticking
      its nose in) interact in an interesting way.

      and receives positive feedback from those that watch or interact.

      When I mention livestreaming to others, they’re often interested in how it
      works, what I get from doing it, what those who interact with the streams
      get out of it and how they could potentially get involved in streaming.

      Git is the dominant tool for version management. Misunderstanding and
      misusing Git can cost development teams time, energy, and money. Few
      better examples exist than Git's default merge workflow which creates
      repositories that are hard to read, debug, and maintain. In this
      talk, I'll show how to use the [Git Rebase
      Workflow](https://www.alchemists.io/articles/git_rebase) instead,
      which puts Git to work for you to produce quality code that's easy to
      handle and kicks your team into high gear.

      Your questions will be answered by [Brooke
      Kuhlmann](https://www.alchemists.io/team/brooke_kuhlmann) who is the
      founder of the [Alchemists](https://www.alchemists.io) where the

      AB testing product variations to statistical significance, and using
      funnel analysis to quantify a feature's value.

      One of the aspects of Ruby & Rails that gives it the reputation for not

      It's often considered best practice to normalize the database structure
      to avoid data redundancy and incoherence. In Pennylane's accounting
      platform we've found that this actually does not always help with data
      coherence, and even introduces additional complexity in managing data
      access. Our combination of denormalizing some of our data, enhancing
      some of ActiveRecord's methods, and introducing default behaviors in our
      application models has enabled us to greatly simplify access control
      management and given us confidence that our production data is in a

    title: Service Objects and Domain objects differences
    description: |-
      Understanding what a service and domain objects are. Distinguishing the
      difference between procedures and objects. Why using service objects is
      a bad idea. Advantages of using modules, concerns and PORO's instead of
      service objects.

      The lights cut out. The crowd roars. It’s time. The band takes the stage.
      They’ve practiced the songs, particularly the *covers*. They’ve sound
      checked the *coverage* of the speakers. They know the lighting rig has the
      proper colored gels *covering* the lamps. They’re nervous, but they’ve got
      it all __covered__.

    title: When ActiveRecord meets CTE!?
    description: |-
      CTE (`Common Table Expression`) is one of the ways we handle complicated
      SQL queries. However, ActiveRecord does not support CTE directly so I used
      to write some raw SQL to implement CTE. Now, I found there is a useful gem
      called `activerecord-cte` which makes things different.

    title: Finding, hiring and onboarding junior Ruby developers
    description: |-
      The Ruby community in London has a huge number of junior
      developers, largely thanks to bootcamps like Le Wagon and Makers Academy.
      This talk describes my experiences finding, hiring and onboarding junior
      devs. The aim is for the hiring managers in the room to feel more confident
      hiring junior devs for their teams, and for the junior devs in the room to
      feel more confident asking for support and learning opportunities.

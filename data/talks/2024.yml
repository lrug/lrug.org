    title: Sky Computing
    description: |-
      What comes after cloud computing? Cloud computing is convenient,
      ubiquitous and relatively cheap. But it also locks developers into proprietary
      solutions that make migrating to another provider or bringing your solutions
      back in-house difficult and expensive. If AWS, Google Cloud Computing, Azure
      and all the others are clouds, then we also need a sky. Researchers at Berkeley
      and other institutions have proposed sky computing: an interoperability layer
      that removes technological lock-in and enables multi cloud application development.'

    title: 'Leveraging Localised Gems (LLGems): Re-using Code the Ruby Way, Safely'
    description: |-
      The talk takes a look under the hood of our Rails monolith, our Rails
      Engines, and how we share code between them. It's a bit like a kitchen
      experiment – blending the best of both worlds to enhance the Separation of
      Concerns, while still keeping our favorite code recipes within reach. I'll
      share our adventure of moving some Kafka infrastructure code from the main
      Rails app into a local gem (with zero downtime!). Think of it as giving the
      code a new home where it can be shared across our Rails Engines. We've also
      managed to preserve our unique, in-house testing infrastructure in the
      process which is a serious Brucie bonus!

    description: |-
      In this talk, I will present a methodology for replicating most standard
      Rails systems, for the purpose of load testing.

      You can use this to find out how your system performs with more traffic than
      you currently encounter. This will be useful if you are on a Rails team that
      is starting to see scaling challenges.

      At Theta Lake we operate at scale and are applying this methodology to
      proactively find ways to bring down our server costs. You don’t want to leave
      it until either your server costs soar out of control, or your entire system
      is about to fail. By seeing into the future just a little bit, you can find
      bottlenecks in your system and so find where you can improve its scalability.

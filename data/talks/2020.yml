      Some time ago I stumbled across the header description for WAV files
      and wondered, what if I took a file and calculated the appropriate WAV
      file header for it, could I _hear_ my data?  Yes, you can.  You probably
      don't want to, but you can.  You can do something similar with BMP and
      MIDI files too!

      [RubyCritic](https://github.com/whitesmith/rubycritic/) provides a
      report about code quality. You can run it locally to view how your
      project is doing and what are the smelly spots. A way of getting sense
      of how your code quality is evolving over time is by setting it up on
      your CI and storing the reports artefacts.

      Email has been around for a long time, predating even the Internet, and
      despite the best efforts of big tech to monopolise our communications,
      it's still the most popular way to for people to communicate online.
      This ubiquity means it's a really easy wayf or Government to keep in
      touch with us, but email is a tricky thing to manage, running
      mailservers can be a faff, and email as a service solutions can be
      expensive. In this talk I'll go through a potted history of email, talk
      about a tool that the Government Digital Service have developed to make
      email easier for goverment agencies, and a Ruby gem I've build to make
      it even easier for Rails devs.

      We all know how valuable it is to keep the quality of your code high. Working on a high quality codebase is more enjoyable and enables us to deliver value much more effectively for our users and yet, time and again I hear engineers saying, “I am not allowed to spend sufficient time on code quality”.

      This talk clarifies the value of maintaining a high quality codebase, gives you guidance on how to talk about this to help you get the support of your colleagues and managers for spending time on this and also outlines some key practices that will help you achieve this.

      Rob's presenting a few experiments in Sonic Pi, covering oddities such as:

      * negative melody
      * Jianpu (numbered musical notation)
      * just intonation
      * microtonal music - 19 EDO (Equal Division of the Octave)
      * interfacing with MIDI controllers over USB and bluetooth BLE.

      Also Rob will walk us through a memory management improvement PR to Sonic Pi - that may have made it into the release.

    description: |-
      My company (Trapeze) specialises in public transport including schedule

      pickup and drop-offs in demand responsive public transport. This talk
      will compare implementing a Hamiltonian curve finder in a number of
      different languages. The talk looks both at the speed of the language
      and the elegance. For Ruby, I compare a couple of different
      implementations. Other languages that are compared are Elixir, Go,
      Javascript, Java, C++, C# and Python.

      The source code is in a public Github repository details of which I will

      In combination with `bundle open` to insert breakpoints into the code of
      gems being used in your stack, debugging can expose really tricky
      dependency bugs, as I aim to demonstrate with one that I found in the
      way different ruby HTTP libraries can interact.

      Today Agile is the default choice for software development out there. Every

      don’t follow this established convention. But isn't it surprising to think
      that Agile is advocated as the right methodology for every possible company
      doing software out there? Are we going to organize software development
      exactly the same way if we are working for a startup, NASA, or FedEx? It
      seems hard to believe. In this presentation, I will explore the mental
      model to help you choose when you should (or sometimes should not) use
      Agile using the lenses of risk management. My goal is to provide guidance

      [Denny de la Haye](https://denny.me) has been a programmer for nearly 30 years
      now - "although my ZX81 code is thankfully all lost in the mists of time (AKA
      audio cassettes and thermal printer paper)", he says. He has spent most of the
      last 4+ years writing Ruby, and most of the 15+ before that writing Perl. The
      switch between the two was less traumatic than he expected, but it did lead to
      starting another open source software project last year...

      > Rails' most well-known mantra is "convention over configuration," i.e. sane
      > defaults that limit the cognitive overhead of application development. It's
      > easy to learn and easy to build with. The development experience is
      > fantastic... right up until the point you want to deploy your app to
      > production. It's at that point that the hand-holding stops.

      > Heroku to the rescue, right? Just push your git repo to "heroku master" and
      > never think about deployment again! Heroku is a great option for many small
      > projects and the ease of deployment is exactly the kind of experience Rails
      > developers are used to. To quote Aaron Patterson: "but at what cost?" You're
      > tied to Heroku's stack and stuck within the limitations of their free tier.
      > Heroku's add-ons can get pretty expensive too if you decide to upgrade later
      > on.

      > How can we, but humble Rails devs, achieve the same seamless, turnkey
      > deployment experience affordably? Enter the Kuby gem, a
      > convention-over-configuration approach to deploying Rails apps using
      > industry-leading technologies. Come learn how, with almost no configuration,
      > you too can use Kuby to leverage Docker and Kubernetes to deploy your Rails
      > app cost-effectively on a variety of cloud platforms.

      [Cameron Dutro](https://twitter.com/camertron) currently works on the Quip team
      at Salesforce. He's been programming in Ruby and using Rails for ten years and
      has held previous positions at Fluther, Twitter, and Lumos Labs. When he's not
      reading about, using, or working on technology, Cameron can be found hiking in
      the hills behind his house or hanging out at home with his wife, daughter, and
      cat.
